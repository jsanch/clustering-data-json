Figures are provided by mandated Response Time and Response Type, for each DCF Area Office each SFY beginning with 2005.  Each report accepted is screened for safety and risk factors, and assigned an amount of time within which the agency is required to respond to the report.  Mandated response times include “Same Day”, “24 Hours”, and “72 Hours”.

Uniform Crime Reporting Program measures the extent, fluctuation and distribution of crime throughout the United States. After counting Crime Index offenses reported, minus any unfounded complaints, contributors provide the number of “actual offenses” and the number of crimes cleared. For a criminal offense to be “cleared,” either of the following situations must prevail: (1) at least one person is arrested, charged, and turned over to the court for prosecution; or (2) some element beyond police control precludes the physical arrest of the offender (e.g., death of offender, victim refuses to cooperate, confession by offender already in police custody), resulting in the offense being cleared by “exceptional means.” Contributing agencies also include data on the value of property stolen and recovered in connection with the reported offenses, plus specific information regarding homicides, officers assaulted and arson.","title":"Uniform Crime Reporting System Offenses 2013","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/rphg-kgwv/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/rphg-kgwv/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/rphg-kgwv/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/rphg-kgwv/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Public Safety"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.ct.gov/d/9cnu-4c7f","issued":"2014-10-29","modified":"2014-10-29","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["ucr","crime","offenses","2013"],"identifier":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/9cnu-4c7f","publisher":{"name":"data.ct.gov"},"description":"The Uniform Crime Reporting Program measures the extent, fluctuation and distribution of crime throughout the United States.

The Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) introduced the four-year cohort graduation rate with the graduating class of 2009. This approach was created when Connecticut and 49 other states signed an agreement with the National Governors’ Association to develop a uniform system for tracking students. The four-year cohort graduation rate is calculated by tracking an individual cohort, or group of students, from their initial entrance into Grade 9 through to graduation. The four-year cohort graduation rate represents the percentage of students who earn a standard high school diploma within four years. The calculation uses individual student-level data from the state's Public School Information System (PSIS) that school districts submitted and superintendents certified.\r\n>> Double plus symbol (††) denotes not applicable\r\n>> Asterisk symbol (*) denotes fewer than six in a cohort is suppressed\r\n>> Outplaced students are counted only in district graduation calculation\r\n>> Row percentages may not add to 100 percent because of rounding\r\n>> District graduation rates may not be the same as the average of the graduation rates of the number schools in that district because of outplaced students.\r\n>> Because each cohort is different from one year to another year, graduation rates are not comparable from year to year.

Census Blocks are statistical areas which in Connecticut are typically bounded by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad lines. Generally, Census Blocks in denser urban communities are small in area, such as a block in a city that is bounded on all sides by streets. However, Census Blocks in suburban and rural areas may be large, or irregular, and bounded by a variety of features, such as roads or streams. For example, a specific Census Block may be partially served by public water and/or sewer, and thus the entire block would appear to be served by these utilities. There were several instances during the public comment period where municipalities requested that certain Census Blocks be removed from this classification, and such requests were granted. Any limitations in the use of Census Blocks in this LGM should not be construed as influencing local land use and zoning decisions or municipal plans of conservation and development; nor should it create any expectation for future utility service where none currently exists.\r\nPriority Funding Areas are classified by Census Blocks that include: \uf0b7 Designation as an Urban Area or Urban Cluster in the 2010 Census Boundaries that intersect a ½ mile buffer surrounding existing or planned mass-transit stations Existing or planned sewer service from an adopted Wastewater Facility Plan Existing or planned water service from an adopted Public Drinking Water Supply Plan Local bus service provided 7 days a week","title":"Conservation and Development Policies Plan 2013-2018 Priority Funding Areas","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/uh3c-4r63/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/uh3c-4r63/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/uh3c-4r63/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/uh3c-4r63/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Government"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.ct.gov/d/88b5-ii6i","issued":"2014-04-21","modified":"2014-10-29","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["ev","ct","charging stations"],"identifier":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/88b5-ii6i","publisher":{"name":"data.ct.gov"},"description":"Existing public Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations within Connecticut from\nUS DOE map found at http://www.afdc.energy.gov/locator/stations/\ncomplemented with research done by DEEP as of 04/07/14","title":"Electric Vehicle Charging Stations","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/88b5-ii6i/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/88b5-ii6i/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/88b5-ii6i/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/88b5-ii6i/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Transportation"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.ct.gov/d/fir6-w458","issued":"2014-04-14","modified":"2014-10-30","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["bacterial infections","parasitic infections","foodborne disease","epidemiology","population surveillance","connecticut"],"identifier":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/fir6-w458","publisher":{"name":"data.ct.gov"},"description":"Foodborne Illness Surveillance in Connecticut, 2000-2012","title":"Connecticut Incident Cases of FoodNet Pathogens by Year 2000-2012","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/fir6-w458/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/fir6-w458/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/fir6-w458/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/fir6-w458/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Health and Human Services"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.ct.gov/d/cfax-6qah","issued":"2014-04-08","modified":"2014-10-30","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:Karyn.backus@ct.gov"},"keyword":["deaths","cause of death"],"identifier":"https://data.ct.gov/api/views/cfax-6qah","publisher":{"name":"data.ct.gov"},"description":"Deaths counts for Connecticut Residents by cause of death.
