CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews.  One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block.  Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes.  On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.  \r\n\r\nIf a previous request is already open for a buffer of 4 addresses the request is given the status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".

By City ordinance, the moratorium is seven (7) years and during this period permit fees are doubled. (3) Median or Median Landscaping is used where landscaped medians or planters exist on the street median.

A Depends Upon Requirements contract is an indefinite quantities contract in which the City places orders as needed and the vendor is not guaranteed any particular contract award amount. \r\n\r\nBlanket vs. Standard Contracts: Only blanket contracts (contracts for repeated purchases) have FMPS end dates. Standard contracts (for example, construction contracts) terminate upon completion and acceptance of all deliverables. These dates are tracked outside of FMPS. \r\n\r\nNegative Modifications: Some contracts are modified to delete scope and money from a contract. These reductions are indicated by negative numbers in the Award Amount field of this dataset. \r\n\r\nData Owner: Procurement Services. \r\nTime Period: 1993 to present. \r\nFrequency: Data is updated daily.","title":"Contracts","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/rsxa-ify5/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/rsxa-ify5/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/rsxa-ify5/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/rsxa-ify5/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Administration & Finance"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/x8fc-8rcq","issued":"2015-09-10","modified":"2015-09-10","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["libraries","facilities","gis"],"identifier":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/x8fc-8rcq","publisher":{"name":"data.cityofchicago.org"},"description":"Chicago Public Library locations, contact information, and hours of operation.","title":"Libraries - Locations, Hours and Contact Information","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/x8fc-8rcq/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/x8fc-8rcq/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/x8fc-8rcq/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/x8fc-8rcq/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Education"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/jp7n-tgmf","issued":"2015-09-09","modified":"2015-09-09","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["tif","sbif","sustainability"],"identifier":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/jp7n-tgmf","publisher":{"name":"data.cityofchicago.org"},"description":"Small Business Improvement Fund (SBIF) program grants made since 2001.

(See City Council Meeting schedule: https://chicago.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx.)  The collection of street segments for a single zone (collectively identified by Zone number) are not required to constitute a seamless polygon; however, they must be contiguous; in this sense, “Zones” often closer resemble a collection of intersecting segments rather than an unbroken area. Segments are commonly categorized as being either “Standard” or “Buffer”: Standard means that signs exist on the street segment beginning at the low-point and ending at the high-point; Buffer means that physical signs do not exist for that zone on that physical street, but residents of addresses within that segment shall have the privilege to purchase zone products (daily permits and annual passes) for that zone, as if physical signs were installed.  (In this way, segments designated as ‘Buffer’ can in fact overlap with either other buffers and/or standard segments.)  Physical signs will display the zone number and the day/times when the zone restriction is in effect, e.g., “All Times” / “Anytime”; “Monday through Friday”; “6am – 6pm All Days.”  During restricted days/times, any vehicle parked in the zone which does not display a valid unexpired zone product (either a daily permit or an annual pass printed on the City Vehicle Sticker) is subject to ticketing/enforcement.

Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.

There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes.

This prohibition does not apply to restaurants, hotels offering restaurant services, or not-for-profit clubs. There are nine major classes of liquor licenses in the City of Chicago, the most common being Tavern, Package Goods and Incidental - Consumption on Premises. These categories were established to help the City identify and regulate the various types of establishments serving alcoholic beverages.

The Chicago City Council has passed a series of ordinances restricting the issuance of liquor licenses in various locations throughout the City in sections 4-60-022 and 4-60-023 of the Municipal Code. In general, consumption on premises liquor licenses are affected by the 022 moratorium and Package Goods are affected by the 023 moratorium. However, moratoriums can be complicated, so determining whether or not a moratorium applies to a specific license application is not always straightforward. Users of the data should contact the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection if they have any questions. These GIS layers show the locations of moratoriums passed by the City Council.
