(BHD), and City of Kansas City, Missouri (City), seeks a sub-developer(s) for a high quality, mixed-income, single family and townhome and/or mixed use residential/commercial project in the Beacon Hill Redevelopment Area, specifically the three corners of 27th and Troost. The boundary extends from Troost Avenue\nto Forest Avenue, from 26th Street to 27th Street and including the southeast, southwest and northeast corners of 27th and Troost Avenue. The site plan information is shown in Attachment A - Existing Master Plan of Beacon Hill, and Attachment B - Urban Design Guidelines for Developer Proposals.\n\nThe purpose of this RFP/Q is to select a qualified sub-developer(s) with proven experience, financial resources, and professional expertise to develop, market, and sell/rent high-quality, residential and commercial land uses, in support of a dynamic, diverse community in the Hospital Hill and Beacon Hill area. Each responding proposal can address any of the three corners within the project area independently or respond to the project in its entirety.\n\nThe selection process will be a single review and award process by a Selection Committee consisting of representatives from the Master Developer (BHD), City, EDC/LCRA staff, and neighborhood stakeholders, with the selected firm(s) subject to a development agreement with specific benchmarks according to design standards approved by the Neighborhood Design Review Committee, and in conformance with the 353 Plan.

The selected sub-developer(s) will enter into a Development Agreement with LCRA that includes the real estate sales or transfers. This solicitation is being made to all interested and qualified developers.","title":"Request For Qualifications And Proposals For The Three Corners At 27th & Troost","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.kcmo.org/download/wksh-qs4d/application/pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf"}],"theme":["Housing"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.kcmo.org/d/ue4f-ecec","issued":"2015-11-12","modified":"2015-11-12","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["application","permit","traffic control"],"identifier":"https://data.kcmo.org/api/views/ue4f-ecec","publisher":{"name":"data.kcmo.org"},"description":"Application for Traffic Control Permit","title":"Application For Traffic Control Permit","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.kcmo.org/download/ue4f-ecec/application/pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf"}],"theme":["Traffic"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.kcmo.org/d/gnzp-i56n","issued":"2015-11-12","modified":"2015-11-12","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:martha.campbell@kcmo.org"},"identifier":"https://data.kcmo.org/api/views/gnzp-i56n","publisher":{"name":"data.kcmo.org"},"description":"Board_of_Zoning_Adjustment_Approved_Minutes_of_9-22-15","title":"Board_of_Zoning_Adjustment_Approved_Minutes_of_9-22-15","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.kcmo.org/download/gnzp-i56n/application/pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf"}],"theme":["Development Review"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.kcmo.org/d/8edt-qc6r","issued":"2015-11-10","modified":"2015-11-10","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["municourt","municipal court","court","clearance","clearance rate","case","case clearance","case clearance rate"],"identifier":"https://data.kcmo.org/api/views/8edt-qc6r","publisher":{"name":"data.kcmo.org"},"description":"This datasets contains performance metrics related to the case clearance rate for the municipal court of Kansas City on a quarterly basis.

Lighting systems. This data is Citywide, and not granular to a specific piece of infrastructure. This is the same information that is reported to the Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB).\r\n\r\nPublic Works has established a program to evaluate the condition of all pavements. The name of the program is the Street Distress Rating System (SDRS). This program rates all segments of pavement over a three year period. The program measures actual physical defects in the pavement system which can be observed and quantified through visual inspection of the roadway surface. Broad categories include cracking, patching, depression, and surface wear. The system calculates the Pavement Condition Index representing a value ranging from \"0\" to \"100\". The department's intent is to achieve and retain a system-wide average value of not less than \"60\". The value below 80 represents a system that needs repairs, and improvements. A rating of \"90\" to \"100\" would show an excellent condition, \"80\" to \"89\" good condition, \"70\" to \"79\" fair condition, and below \"70\", poor condition.\r\n\r\nThe condition of bridges is measured using the Federal Highway Administration Rating System. The Federal system uses a measurement scale that is based on a condition index ranging from zero for a failed bridge to 100 for a bridge in perfect condition.  The condition index is used to classify bridges and culverts in good or better condition (65 and 75 on up, respectively), fair condition (45 to 65) and substandard condition (less than 45).  It is the City’s policy to maintain, on average, at least 75 percent of its bridge system at a good or better condition level.  No more than 10 percent should be in the substandard condition.  Condition assessments are determined every other year.  All bridges are rated at least once every two years.\r\n\r\nThe condition of street lighting is measured using a system designed by the City. The system uses a measurement scale that is based on an assigned condition index to a streetlight of zero for failing or 100 for passing each measured factor and measures 16 different factors.  The condition index is used to classify street lighting in better condition ( 90 and up), good condition ( 80 to 89) and substandard condition (less than 80).  It is the City’s policy to maintain an overall average of at least 90 percent condition rating (better condition rating) for the entire street light system.  No more than 10 percent of the entire street lighting system should be below the better condition rating.  Condition assessments are determined every year.  Street lights are selected for condition assessments systematically by private contractor hired to assess and immediately repair all street lights inspected.  The plan is to have 100 percent of all street lights inspected, with corresponding repairs, every two years.","title":"Road, Bridge, and Street Lighting Overall

In addition, the city auditor has the authority and responsibility to initiate audits.\r\n\r\nTo develop an annual audit plan and select performance audits that can result in improved city operations and services to the public, the City Auditor’s Office considers a variety of factors including risks, Council priorities, KCStat, citizen surveys, past audits, and input and concerns from the City Council and city management.  We also ask the public for their ideas about potential audit topics.\r\n\r\nThe annual audit plan is subject to review and revision throughout the year.
