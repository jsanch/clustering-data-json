This targeting method is superior to using “scattershot” methods that might attract these preferred groups. Segmentation explains customer diversity, simplifies marketing campaigns, describes lifestyle and lifestage, and incorporates a wide range of data. Segmentation systems operate on the theory that people with similar tastes, lifestyles, and behaviors seek others with the same tastes—“like seeks like.” These behaviors can be measured, predicted, and targeted. Esri’s Tapestry Segmentation system combines the “who” of lifestyle demography with the “where” of local neighborhood geography to create a model of various lifestyle classifications or segments of actual neighborhoods with addresses—distinct behavioral market segments. The tapestry segmentation is almost comical in the sense that it trys to describe such small details of individuals daily lives just by analyzing the data provided on your CENSUS form. These segements are not only ideal for marketing and targeting lifestyles within a geographic location, but they are fun to read. Take the time to find out which segment you live in!","title":"Census Tapestry Segmentation","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"http://geoengine.utc.edu:6080/arcgis/rest/services/THRIVE/Census_Tapestry_Segmentation/MapServer/0","mediaType":"Esri REST"},{"downloadURL":"http://geoportal.congeo.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0117ad35fb084831979c7f1e25e02a9e_0.csv","mediaType":"CSV"},{"downloadURL":"http://geoportal.congeo.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0117ad35fb084831979c7f1e25e02a9e_0.zip","mediaType":"ZIP"},{"downloadURL":"http://geoportal.congeo.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0117ad35fb084831979c7f1e25e02a9e_0","mediaType":"HTML"},{"downloadURL":"http://geoportal.congeo.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0117ad35fb084831979c7f1e25e02a9e_0.geojson","mediaType":"GeoJSON"},{"downloadURL":"http://geoportal.congeo.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0117ad35fb084831979c7f1e25e02a9e_0.kml","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.chattlibrary.org/d/yfqy-s6wc","issued":"2014-12-04","modified":"2015-06-04","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["rri","chattanooga","thrive 2055"],"identifier":"https://data.chattlibrary.org/api/views/yfqy-s6wc","publisher":{"name":"data.chattlibrary.org"},"description":"A list of address locations of Farmers’ Markets was compiled by Gaining Ground in July 2011.
