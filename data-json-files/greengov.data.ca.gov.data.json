Production capacity has substantial growth potential, but current low production volumes result in a $30,000 to $70,000 hybrid vehicle cost premium.  ARB expects production costs to decline as hybrid driveline production volumes increase.  When this occurs, the fuel economy payback period should shorten to the point where a hybrid truck purchase is economical without incentives and the technology is self-sustaining.  ARB envisions the HVIP as a multi-year project to bridge this gap.
