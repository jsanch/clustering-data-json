Current year data is updated monthly.  In the 1800’s, the processes for birth registration were not as established as they are today. Births could have been registered in other places, such as churches, and not all births were reported.  Given this, the number of births recorded early on may only represent a subset of the actual births that occurred during that time period.  Blank names mean that the birth certificate did not have a name listed.  There is no requirement that the baby's name be determined prior to the birth certificate being registered.  Birth certificates can be amended through the state at a later date to add the first name, if the  individual desires to do so.","title":"Sonoma County Baby Names","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.sonomacounty.ca.gov/api/views/4ecf-2vnd/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.sonomacounty.ca.gov/api/views/4ecf-2vnd/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.sonomacounty.ca.gov/api/views/4ecf-2vnd/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.sonomacounty.ca.gov/api/views/4ecf-2vnd/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Fun"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.sonomacounty.ca.gov/d/ahc2-pu7p","issued":"2015-09-23","modified":"2015-09-23","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"identifier":"https://data.sonomacounty.ca.gov/api/views/ahc2-pu7p","publisher":{"name":"data.sonomacounty.ca.gov"},"description":"Operating Budget Revenue2","title":"Operating Budget Revenue2","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.sonomacounty.ca.gov/api/views/ahc2-pu7p/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.sonomacounty.ca.gov/api/views/ahc2-pu7p/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.sonomacounty.ca.gov/api/views/ahc2-pu7p/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.sonomacounty.ca.gov/api/views/ahc2-pu7p/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.sonomacounty.ca.gov/d/8nsx-2m6i","issued":"2015-07-20","modified":"2015-09-01","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:OpenData@sonoma-county.org"},"keyword":["budget"],"identifier":"https://data.sonomacounty.ca.gov/api/views/8nsx-2m6i","publisher":{"name":"data.sonomacounty.ca.gov"},"description":"This dataset contains the most current approved budget values for the current fiscal year.
