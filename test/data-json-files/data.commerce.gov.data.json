In this method, all chemical compounds are annotated in terms of standard chemical structural fragments. These fragments are then organized into a data tree based on their chemical substructures. Search engines have been developed to use this data tree. These search engines use the Chem-BLAST technique to search on the fragments and look for their chemical structural neighbors. The technique was originally developed in the context of the HIV Structural database to enable a query on inhibitors of HIV protease. (See http://xpdb.nist.gov/hivsdb/hivsdb.html.) Recently the method has been significantly improved to extend to the ligands found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). (See http://xpdb.nist.gov/chemblast/pdb.html.)  The method establishes a tree-like relationship between the rings found in three-letter codes that denote ligands of the structures found in the PDB. Semantic Web relations are established between the structural scaffolds of the ligands and organizes them in an XML database utilizing the Web�??s Resource Description Framework (RDF). An Adobe Flex-based interface is used to present this information on the Web. Plans are under way to extend this work to non-ring type scaffolds as well. Chem-BLAST has also been extended to structures in PubChem. http://xpdb.nist.gov/chemblast/pdb.pl which includes several non-ring standard reused groups such as sulfates.

A tissue sample taken from a live fish can be used for DNA analyses, which can identify the species of fish, as well as the unique individual fish. Taking a small tissue sample without bringing the fish to the surface is important as it allows for observing the fish community without harming the individual fish by inducing barotrauma or other stresses associated with bringing a fish up from depth, which can be lethal to the animal. These tissue samples are obtained by hook and line methods and do not capture or traumatize the fish resulting in a non-lethal and non-destructive method of observing fish individuals and species. The DNA Sampling Hook is specifically designed to virtually eliminate a condition called double bites, in which more than one individual fish gives up tissue to the same hook. It is also designed to protect the tissue sample in an enclosed manner and the device can be reused repeatedly for a total overall reduction in cost for programs requiring extensive numbers of tissue samples for DNA analysis.","title":"DNA Sampling Hook","programCode":["006:000"],"distribution":[{"downloadURL":"http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=7823321&OS=7823321&RS=7823321","mediaType":"text/html"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["006:48"],"landingPage":"https://data.commerce.gov/d/3nn4-7dwe","issued":"2015-03-25","modified":"2015-03-25","keyword":["histogram","noise","power","sensor","signal","spectrum","transient"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"Derek Parks","hasEmail":"mailto:Derek.Parks@noaa.gov"},"publisher":{"name":"Department of Commerce"},"identifier":"https://data.commerce.gov/api/views/3nn4-7dwe","description":"Signal processing is used to detect transient signals in the presence of noise.

The moments of each peak in every power spectrum are calculated and the peak with the largest power selected from each power spectrum. A histogram of the moments from these selected peaks is generated and normalized to become a measured PDF. In addition, a pre-determined PDF is derived, in the same method as above, from theoretically calculated noise, numerically simulated noise, or measured noise. Comparison between the measured and pre-determined PDF's establish the detection of a transient signal. The first embodiment compares the area between the measured and pre-determined PDF's against a threshold to determine detection.

This crawl operates continually and will be retrieving both already-submitted documents and new documents as the USPTO makes them publicly available.\r\n\r\nExcept for repackaging into zip files, these documents are hosted by Reed Tech unchanged. A single zip file is created for each patent application. There is detailed documentation about the format as well as the overview below.\r\n\r\nHow to access PAIR data:\r\nTo access a particular zipfile, replace APP_NUM in the following URL with an application number of interest:  \r\nhttp://patents.reedtech.com/downloads/pair/APP_NUM.zip  \r\n  \r\nFor example: http://patents.reedtech.com/downloads/pair/12102391.zip                                                                                               \r\nOver 6,591,434 applications are available. Additional applications will be added regularly as the crawl progresses. \r\n\r\nOverview of zipfile contents:\r\nEach zipfile contains the following:  \r\n•A README.txt file which indicates when the data was obtained.\r\n•Data files (*.tsv), in tab-delimited text format, compatible with many spreadsheet programs. Each data file represents one tab from the PAIR interface: Address and Attorney/Agent, Application Data, Continuity Data, Foreign Priority, Image File Wrapper, Patent Term Adjustments / Extension History, Transaction History. \r\n◦Data tables from the PAIR interface are organized in one of two ways: \r\n1. Labels in the first column. (Example: Application Data tab.) The second column contains the corresponding value (example: Application number and 12/102,391).\r\n2. Labels in the first row. (Example: Transaction History tab, with labels such as Date and Transaction Description.) Each subsequent row contains the corresponding values for one data item. (In the example, each row represents a single transaction.) \r\n◦Some *.tsv files contain more than one table, separated by a blank line. \r\n◦The Image File Wrapper data file is put in a separate directory along with the additional content that it links to. An extra Filename column is added to the *.tsv file to indicate the appropriate file for each item.\r\n•Image files (*.pdf), in Adobe PDF format. This data is only available for patent applications which have an Image File Wrapper tab on the USPTO PAIR site. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nNo guarantees are made with respect to the completeness or accuracy of this data. In particular, the crawl may discover and retrieve additional documents over time, even for applications submitted long ago.

Provisional lists will be announced on this site as they are decided.","title":"North American Product Classification System (NAPCS)","programCode":["006:007"],"distribution":[{"downloadURL":"http://www.census.gov/eos/www/napcs/index.html","mediaType":"text/html"}],"describedBy":"http://www.census.gov/eos/www/napcs/documentlinks.html","dataQuality":true},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.commerce.gov/d/krz7-8fsy","bureauCode":["006:07"],"issued":"1979-01-01","modified":"2015-03-25","references":["http://www.census.gov/mtis/how_surveys_are_collected.html"],"keyword":["accessories","agents","appliance","beverage","book","brokers","building","care","clothing","commission","commodity","dealers","distributors","domestic","durable","electronics","equipment","establishments","exporters","exports","firms","food","furnishings","furniture","garden","gasoline","general","goods","health","hobby","home","importers","imports","industrial","inventories","inventory","jobbers","mtis","manufacture","manufacturing","material","materials","merchandise","merchant","merchants","miscellaneous","monthly","motor","music","nondurable","nonstore","parts","personal","retail","retailers","sales","sporting","stations","store","stores","supplies","trade","u s","vehicle","wholesale","wholesalers"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"Robert A.
