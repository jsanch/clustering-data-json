The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.

dataset is a compendium of geocoded points culled from SACOG employment data & enhanced by information from the California Department of Education's (CDE) Dataquest site. Enrollment and employment information for public schools is for the 2009-2010 school year information downloaded from Dataquest, with employment based on Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) staff numbers. Enrollment and emplyment for some private schools was found in CDE's Private Schools Database. For a few private schools, enrollmetn data was found on the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sacramento's schools website; employment numbers for those schools was imputed based on the average of 9.5 students per FTE staff person found in other private schools. Some private schools do not make enrollment or employment information available and thus have \"0\" in those columns. Schools which we could determine have closed will have zeros in those columns as well as having \"CLOSED\" in the 'Status' field.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://gis-server.cityofwestsacramento.org/arcgis/rest/services/SACOG/SACOG/MapServer/13","title":"Schools 2010","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofwestsacramento.org/api/views/9khp-ybdh/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofwestsacramento.org/api/views/9khp-ybdh/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofwestsacramento.org/api/views/9khp-ybdh/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofwestsacramento.org/api/views/9khp-ybdh/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cityofwestsacramento.org/d/vfpj-k2bq","issued":"2015-01-30","modified":"2015-01-30","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:gis@cityofwestsacramento.org"},"identifier":"https://data.cityofwestsacramento.org/api/views/vfpj-k2bq","publisher":{"name":"data.cityofwestsacramento.org"},"description":"https://gis-server.cityofwestsacramento.org/arcgis/rest/services/SACOG/SACOG/MapServer/12","title":"RT Bus Stops","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofwestsacramento.org/api/views/vfpj-k2bq/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofwestsacramento.org/api/views/vfpj-k2bq/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofwestsacramento.org/api/views/vfpj-k2bq/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofwestsacramento.org/api/views/vfpj-k2bq/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cityofwestsacramento.org/d/jzk4-8gnm","issued":"2015-01-30","modified":"2015-01-30","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:gis@cityofwestsacramento.org"},"identifier":"https://data.cityofwestsacramento.org/api/views/jzk4-8gnm","publisher":{"name":"data.cityofwestsacramento.org"},"description":"Park-and-Ride lots in the SACOG region.\r\n\r\nhttps://gis-server.cityofwestsacramento.org/arcgis/rest/services/SACOG/SACOG/MapServer/11","title":"Park-and-Ride Lots","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofwestsacramento.org/api/views/jzk4-8gnm/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofwestsacramento.org/api/views/jzk4-8gnm/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofwestsacramento.org/api/views/jzk4-8gnm/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofwestsacramento.org/api/views/jzk4-8gnm/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cityofwestsacramento.org/d/v8e6-q9ei","issued":"2015-01-30","modified":"2015-01-30","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:gis@cityofwestsacramento.org"},"identifier":"https://data.cityofwestsacramento.org/api/views/v8e6-q9ei","publisher":{"name":"data.cityofwestsacramento.org"},"description":"Active stations along Sacramento Regional Transit's Light Rail system.
