This dataset was generated using data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR). SEER collects information on incidence, survival, and prevalence from specific geographic areas representing 26 percent of the US population and compiles reports on all of these plus cancer mortality for the entire US. NPCR includes population-based data about the occurrence of cancer (incidence), the types of cancer (morphology), the site in the body where the cancer first occurred (primary site), the extent of disease at the time of diagnosis (stage), the planned first course of treatment, and the outcome of treatment and clinical management (survival and vital status). Cancer incidence data are reported to metropolitan area, regional, and statewide cancer registries from a variety of medical facilities, including hospitals, physicians' offices, radiation facilities, freestanding surgical centers, and pathology laboratories. The primary source of data on cancer incidence is medical records. Staff at health care facilities abstract data from patients' medical records, enter it into the facility's own cancer registry if it has one, and then send the data to the regional or state registry.
