Population density is calculated by dividing the total population count of geographic feature by the area of the feature, in square miles. The area is calculated from the geometry of the geographic feature in projected coordinates. The best use of this map is at the larger scales (tracts and block groups).\n\nThe geography depicts States at greater than 50m scale, Counties at 7.5m to 50m scale, Census Tracts at 200k to 7.5m scale, and Census Block Groups at less than 200k scale.\n\nScale Range: 1:591,657,528 down to 1:72,224\n\nFor more information on this map, including our terms of use, visit us online at http://goto.arcgisonline.com/maps/Demographics/USA_Population_Density","title":"Tracts [arcgis_rest_services_Demographics_USA_Population_Density_MapServer_2]","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.raleighnc.gov/api/views/qyqu-akzq/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.raleighnc.gov/api/views/qyqu-akzq/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.raleighnc.gov/api/views/qyqu-akzq/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.raleighnc.gov/api/views/qyqu-akzq/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.raleighnc.gov/d/xir5-xnnk","issued":"2014-03-03","modified":"2014-10-31","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"identifier":"https://data.raleighnc.gov/api/views/xir5-xnnk","publisher":{"name":"data.raleighnc.gov"},"description":"https://maps.raleighnc.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Census/MapServer/1","title":"Census Block Groups 2010","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.raleighnc.gov/api/views/xir5-xnnk/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.raleighnc.gov/api/views/xir5-xnnk/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.raleighnc.gov/api/views/xir5-xnnk/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.raleighnc.gov/api/views/xir5-xnnk/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Census"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.raleighnc.gov/d/igdi-zguw","issued":"2014-03-03","modified":"2014-10-30","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"identifier":"https://data.raleighnc.gov/api/views/igdi-zguw","publisher":{"name":"data.raleighnc.gov"},"description":"https://maps.raleighnc.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Census/MapServer/0","title":"Census Tracts 2010","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.raleighnc.gov/api/views/igdi-zguw/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.raleighnc.gov/api/views/igdi-zguw/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.raleighnc.gov/api/views/igdi-zguw/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.raleighnc.gov/api/views/igdi-zguw/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Census"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.raleighnc.gov/d/7bji-iffi","issued":"2014-02-28","modified":"2015-06-29","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["hospitals","heart","north carolina hospitals","health"],"identifier":"https://data.raleighnc.gov/api/views/7bji-iffi","publisher":{"name":"data.raleighnc.gov"},"description":"A filtered list from HealthData.gov on heart related mortality rates among patients in North Carolina Hospitals.
