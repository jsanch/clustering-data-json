The basic purpose of the Call is to “call out” water rights that are not in priority in order to make water available to the senior water right that is diverting less than its decreed amount of water that it could beneficially use.","title":"DWR Calls History","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.colorado.gov/api/views/t7na-sz5k/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.colorado.gov/api/views/t7na-sz5k/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.colorado.gov/api/views/t7na-sz5k/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.colorado.gov/api/views/t7na-sz5k/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Water"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.colorado.gov/d/m9cg-gqek","issued":"2015-10-30","modified":"2015-11-13","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["surface water supply index","sub-basin"],"identifier":"https://data.colorado.gov/api/views/m9cg-gqek","publisher":{"name":"data.colorado.gov"},"description":"The Surface Water Supply Index (SWSI) is used as an indicator of surface water supply conditions in Colorado.

No livestock water tanks can be used for irrigation purposes.\r\nErosion control dams are governed under Colorado statute (see section 37-87-122, C.R.S. (1990). These types of structures may be constructed on water courses which have been determined by the state engineer to be normally dry (which for our purposes is dry more than 80% of the time). Structures of this type cannot exceed fifteen feet from the bottom of the channel to the bottom of the spillway and cannot exceed ten acre-feet at the emergency spillway level. The height of the dam is measured vertically from the lowest point of the upstream toe to the crest of the dam in contrast to those measured vertically from the centerline pursuant to section 37-87-105, C.R.S.

CBMS.  Releases are categorized as minor or major.  Minor releases primarily address help desk tickets (depending on complexity).  Major releases typically include deployments of specific projects that introduce new functionality or changes to existing functionality.  Major releases could also include infrastructure or performance improvement changes.  \r\n\r\nThe specific content of each release is planned with the Program Areas (specifically HCPF and CDHS) and the State. The release information and dates are communicated in advance to the impacted counties.  This is to ensure coordination across entities and provide awareness prior to any system change.","title":"CBMS - Release

Anyone with a current hunting/fishing license, or boat, snowmobile, ATV registration is already covered by the fund.\r\n\r\nThe card is not insurance and does not reimburse individuals nor does it pay for medical transport. Medical transport includes helicopter flights or ground ambulance. If aircraft are used as a search vehicle, those costs are reimbursed by the fund. If the aircraft becomes a medical transport due to a medical emergency, the medical portion of the transport is not covered.\r\n\r\nThe CORSAR cards are available for $3 for one year and $12 for five

In 2012 Colorado implemented the Transitional Colorado Assessment Program (TCAP) to reflect changes in the state adopted academic content standards and to provide information to teachers as they began incorporating the revised content standards in their daily instruction.\r\nThe Transitional Colorado Assessment Program (TCAP) is Colorado’s standards-based assessment designed to provide a picture of student performance to schools, districts, educators, parents and the community. The primary purpose of the assessment program is to determine the level at which Colorado students meet the Colorado Model Content Standards in the content areas assessed. The TCAP is collaboratively developed by the Colorado Department of Education, the Colorado teaching community and CTB/McGraw-Hill.","title":"2013 TCAP School and District Summary Results - Reading (Grades 3 - 10)","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.colorado.gov/api/views/y2pa-67y6/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.colorado.gov/api/views/y2pa-67y6/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.colorado.gov/api/views/y2pa-67y6/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.colorado.gov/api/views/y2pa-67y6/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["K-12"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.colorado.gov/d/w88j-pefv","issued":"2013-12-03","modified":"2014-10-28","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["colorado department of public safety","cdps","crime rates","incarceration rates"],"identifier":"https://data.colorado.gov/api/views/w88j-pefv","publisher":{"name":"data.colorado.gov"},"description":"National or state offense totals are based on data from all reporting agencies and estimates for unreported areas.

(Copyright 2011. The Trust for Public Land. All Rights Reserved) In 2011, The Trust for Public Land (TPL) partnered with Great Outdoors Colorado (GOCO) to examine conservation priorities for children's access to green spaces, protecting riparian habitats, and enhancing regional trail connectivity across the 8-county Denver Metropolitan region. The study area for this project includes all or portions of the following counties: Adams, Arapahoe, Jefferson, Denver, Douglas, Weld, Broomfield, and Boulder. Study area boundaries were defined to encompass the Denver Regional 2035 Urban Growth boundary, using the MPO boundary to the east and the mountain backdrop to the west. A fundamental milestone for this project was to create an up-to-date inventory of publicly accessible parks, green space, and trails. The dataset depicts publicly access parks and open space, with over 30 jurisdictions and organizations contributing data including: Counties: Adams Arapahoe Jefferson Denver Douglas Weld Broomfield Boulder Cities and Local Jurisdictions: Arvada Aurora Boulder Brighton Castle Rock Commerce City Golden Greenwood Village Highlands Ranch Ken Caryl Lakewood Littleton Longmont Louisville Parker Thornton Westminster Wheat Ridge Foot Hills Recreation District South Suburban Parks and Recreation Other Partners: Learning Landscapes DRCOG COMAP State of Colorado Colorado Open Lands","title":"Greenprint Data - Parks & Open Space","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"http://gis.drcog.org/datacatalog/content/greenprint-data-parks-open-space","mediaType":"open dataset source in new window"}],"theme":["Recreation"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.colorado.gov/d/ihhr-267b","issued":"2012-05-30","modified":"2014-12-16","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:skarjala@drcog.org"},"identifier":"https://data.colorado.gov/api/views/ihhr-267b","publisher":{"name":"data.colorado.gov"},"description":"This file contains a record for each reported traffic crash in the Region.
