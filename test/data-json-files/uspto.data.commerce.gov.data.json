This crawl operates continually and will be retrieving both already-submitted documents and new documents as the USPTO makes them publicly available.\r\n\r\nExcept for repackaging into zip files, these documents are hosted by Reed Tech unchanged. A single zip file is created for each patent application. There is detailed documentation about the format as well as the overview below.\r\n\r\nHow to access PAIR data:\r\nTo access a particular zipfile, replace APP_NUM in the following URL with an application number of interest:  \r\nhttp://patents.reedtech.com/downloads/pair/APP_NUM.zip  \r\n  \r\nFor example: http://patents.reedtech.com/downloads/pair/12102391.zip                                                                                               \r\nOver 6,591,434 applications are available. Additional applications will be added regularly as the crawl progresses. \r\n\r\nOverview of zipfile contents:\r\nEach zipfile contains the following:  \r\n•A README.txt file which indicates when the data was obtained.\r\n•Data files (*.tsv), in tab-delimited text format, compatible with many spreadsheet programs. Each data file represents one tab from the PAIR interface: Address and Attorney/Agent, Application Data, Continuity Data, Foreign Priority, Image File Wrapper, Patent Term Adjustments / Extension History, Transaction History. \r\n◦Data tables from the PAIR interface are organized in one of two ways: \r\n1. Labels in the first column. (Example: Application Data tab.) The second column contains the corresponding value (example: Application number and 12/102,391).\r\n2. Labels in the first row. (Example: Transaction History tab, with labels such as Date and Transaction Description.) Each subsequent row contains the corresponding values for one data item. (In the example, each row represents a single transaction.) \r\n◦Some *.tsv files contain more than one table, separated by a blank line. \r\n◦The Image File Wrapper data file is put in a separate directory along with the additional content that it links to. An extra Filename column is added to the *.tsv file to indicate the appropriate file for each item.\r\n•Image files (*.pdf), in Adobe PDF format. This data is only available for patent applications which have an Image File Wrapper tab on the USPTO PAIR site. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nNo guarantees are made with respect to the completeness or accuracy of this data. In particular, the crawl may discover and retrieve additional documents over time, even for applications submitted long ago.

The file formats are Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in accordance with the U.S. Patent Grant Version 2.4 Document Type Definition (DTD) and eXtensible Markup Language (XML) in accordance with the U.S. Patent Grant Version 2.5; 4.0 International Common Element (ICE); 4.1 ICE; 4.2 ICE; 4.3 ICE; 4.4 ICE and 4.5 ICE Document Type Definitions (DTDs). Because of the concatenation of the individual SGML/XML documents, these files will not parse successfully or open/display by default in Internet Explorer. They also will not import into MS Excel. Each SGML/XML document within the file should have one start tag and one end tag. Concatenation creates a file that contains 4,000 plus start/end tag combinations. If you take one document out of the Patent Grant Bibliographic Text file and place it in a directory with the correct DTD and then double click that individual document, Internet Explorer will parse/open the document successfully. NOTE:  You may receive a warning about Active X controls. NOTE:  All Patent Grant Bibliographic Text files will open successfully in MS Word; NotePad; WordPad; and TextPad.
