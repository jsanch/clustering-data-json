The dataset contains records for each individual, scenic, or interior landmark, as well as properties or sites located within the boundaries of historic districts. Please note that points in this dataset represent individual buildings in addition to non-building sites (such as vacant lots or monuments) regulated by LPC. It is possible for a single property to have multiple designations (such as individual and interior designations, or individual and historic district). For this reason, it is not uncommon to see multiple points on a single tax lot and multiple records for a single property within the database. Please pay close attention to the \"MOST_CURRENT,\" \"BBL_STATUS and \"LAST_ACTION_ON_LP\" fields, which together denote the designation status of a site/property (see Attribute Definitions for more information).

The 2000–2002 CAFRs show outstanding general obligation debt, before Treasury Obligations, in 2000 and 2001 as $26,892 million and $26,836 million, respectively. However, CAFRs from 2003 on show higher GO debt for the two years, $353 million more for 2000 and $311 million more for 2001; the 2003 CAFR does not provide a note explaining the revisions. IBO uses the numbers reported from 2003 forward.\n3Fiscal years 2000, 2002, and 2003 include short-term bond anticipation notes outstanding at year-end of $515 million, $2.2 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively.\n4For fiscal year 2000, Capital Lease Obligations to HHC and PCDC are reported jointly. \n5In FY 2008, JSDC bonds outstanding were redeemed with GO bond proceeds, resulting in the elimination of JSDC debt, a reduction in conduit debt outstanding and partially accounting for the increase in GO debt from 2007 to 2008\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nGeneral Obligation:\nGeneral obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the city. City property tax collections are pledged first to pay the principal and interest on these bonds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTreasury Obligations:\nTreasury obligations are New York City bonds held as investments by the city or by the related entities covered here, including MAC and SFC. They are netted out in order to avoid double counting of the city's obligations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTransitional Finance Authority:\nCreated in 1997, the Transitional Finance Authority (TFA) is a separate legal entity from the City of New York. TFA General Purpose Bonds are secured by the city's collections of personal income tax and, if necessary, sales tax.  Recovery Bonds, issued in response to the events of September 11, 2001 differ from general purpose bonds in that they are excluded from the calculation of outstanding TFA debt allowed under the debt limit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTFA Building Aid Revenue Bonds:\nIn fiscal year 2006, the city was authorized by the state Legislature to assign to the TFA all or any portion of the state building aid payable to the city or its school district. The TFA in turn is authorized to issue bonds secured by the aid and dedicated to financing a portion of the city's educational facilities capital plan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTSASC:\nTSASC Inc. (formerly known as the Tobacco Settlement Asset Securitization Corporation) is a separate legal entity from the City of New York. TSASC bonds are secured by the corporation's purchase from the city of the future revenue stream under a settlement agreement resolving cigarette smoking-related litigation between the settling states and participating manufacturers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMunicipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York:\nThe Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) was a separate legal entity from the City of New York, created in 1975 and formally dissolved in 2008. With New York City experiencing a severe fiscal crisis in 1975, MAC allowed the city continued access to credit markets and assisted in the prevention of a default of city general obligation bonds. MAC bonds were secured by state collections of certain sales and compensating use taxes (imposed by the state within the city at rates formerly imposed by the city), the stock transfer tax, and certain per capita state aid.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSamurai Funding Corporation:\nThe Samurai Funding Corporation (SFC) was a separate legal entity from the City of New York, which issued Japanese yen-denominated bonds. The yen-denominated bonds were secured by the proceeds of New York City general obligation bonds held by SFC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nConduit Debt:\nThe city makes annual appropriations from its general fund for agreements with other entities that issue debt to build or maintain facilities on behalf of the city. These agreements are known as \"leaseback\" transactions, where the city makes rental payments to the partner entity in an amount sufficient to pay the entity's debt service on the securities issued for the respective capital expenditures. These entities, though legally separate from the city, either provide services exclusively to the city, have governance boards whose majority is appointed by the city, or are otherwise subject to the city's imposition of its will on the activities of the entity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nExcluded Items:\nIBO considered several other items for inclusion as outstanding debt of the City of New York that were ultimately determined not to constitute obligations of the city, including: outstanding bonds of the Fiscal Year 2005 Securitization Corporation (FSC), outstanding bonds of the Sales Tax Asset Receivable Corporation (STAR), notes of the Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation (HYIC), and general capital lease obligations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFSC is a financing instrumentality of the city, formed for the purpose of issuing bonds, the proceeds of which were used to acquire securities, held in escrow, which economically defeased city general obligation bonds. As the general obligation bonds in question are included in the calculation of outstanding general obligation debt, the inclusion of the FSC bonds as well would constitute a double counting. As such, IBO does not count FSC debt outstanding toward total New York City debt outstanding.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSTAR is a financing instrumentality of the city, formed for the purpose of issuing bonds, the proceeds of which were used to assume the remaining obligations of MAC. STAR pays the debt service on these bonds with revenues received from the Local Government Assistance Corporation, a state entity whose revenues are 1 percent of the statewide sales tax. The debt of STAR is not an obligation of the city, and the revenues used to pay STAR debt service would not accrue to the city in the corporation's absence. As such, IBO does not count STAR debt outstanding toward total New York City debt outstanding.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nHYIC entered into an agreement with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to purchase from the MTA Transferrable Development Rights.  $200 million of notes were issued by HYIC, the proceeds of which were used to execute the transaction. Debt service on the notes was paid from the proceeds of the bonds issued by HYIC which are included in IBO's definition of outstanding debt under conduit debt.  Therefore, inclusion in outstanding debt of the notes in addition to the bonds would constitute a double counting. As such, IBO does not count HYIC notes outstanding toward total New York City debt outstanding.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIn addition to the capital leases deemed to be debt obligations of the city under conduit debt, various city agencies have entered into leases that have been determined under generally accepted accounting practices to be capital leases. Unlike issuers of conduit debt, the lessors of these general lease obligations do not exist to provide services exclusively to the city, do not have boards the majority of whose members are appointed by the city, or are not otherwise subject to the city's imposition of its will on their activities. These general capital lease obligations do not constitute an obligation of the city toward any bonds or other borrowing. As such, IBO does not count general capital lease obligations toward total New York City debt outstanding.\n.","title":"NYC Independent Budget Office (IBO) Debt Outstanding Since FY 2000","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/5i9t-mvdt/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/5i9t-mvdt/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/5i9t-mvdt/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/5i9t-mvdt/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["City Government"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/6ggx-itps","issued":"2014-03-06","modified":"2014-10-25","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["nyc independent budget office (ibo) debt service since fy 2000","general obligation (go)","transitional finance authority (tfa)","conduit debt","municipal assistance corporation (mac)","net equity contribution in bond refunding that accrued to future years' debt service savings","adjusted debt service expense of outstanding debt as defined by ibo"],"identifier":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/6ggx-itps","publisher":{"name":"data.cityofnewyork.us"},"description":"Annual spending on debt service from FY 2000 - 2014.\n\nSOURCES: IBO; Mayor's Office of Management and Budget (OMB); New York City Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the Comptroller (various years); Annual Report of the Comptroller on Capital Debt and Obligations (various years); New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (various years)\n\nNOTES:\n1Debt service is the cost to New York City of repaying its outstanding debt, including both principal and interest. The figures in the table have been adjusted to reflect debt service that was originally scheduled for payment in each year since 2000.\n2By law, New York City is required to have a balanced annual budget. In years when it runs a surplus, the primary means the city uses to comply with this requirement is to use up some or all of the surplus by prepaying some of the subsequent years’ debt service expenses.

This included a one time expense of $161 million for redeeming all bonds issued under a secured loan agreement with the United States Department of Transportation, via the department's Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. Additionally, all prior year TSASC bond series were defeased, leaving only Series 2006-1 bonds outstanding.\n10MWFA has defeased $14.8 billion of bonds as of June 30, 2012.

Corporation Counsel Michael A. Cardozo initiated the Public Service Program - a private/public partnership with the City's prominent law firms, where firms either lend their attorneys to the Law Department for a finite period of time or agree to take on City cases in-house. The Program benefits both the City and the law firms. The City receives the assistance of an incredibly well-trained and talented group of attorneys while the attorneys receive the kind of hands-on, in-court litigation experience that is often hard to come by at the best private law firms. While participation in the Program will not lead to offers of permanent employment at the Law Department, it will enable the volunteers to keep their skills fresh while serving the public. \r\nTrial Attorney Volunteers: A number of firms lend mid-level litigation associates to the Law Department for a period of four to six months to work full-time in our Tort Division trial units. These attorneys conduct back-to-back civil trials, selecting juries, examining and cross-examining witnesses and presenting opening statements and closing arguments.\r\nLaw Firm Volunteers: Other firms have chosen to take entire matters in-house, giving their attorneys the chance to participate in court conferences, settlement negotiations, depositions, and, ultimately, trials.\r\nDeposition Program: Firms also lend associates to the Law Department either to conduct a series of depositions in an individual case or to spend two to three weeks in our offices conducting back-to-back depositions in a variety of cases.","title":"LAW Public Service Program","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/yk6f-pa7p/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/yk6f-pa7p/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/yk6f-pa7p/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/yk6f-pa7p/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["City Government"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/t6g4-rw7k","issued":"2013-06-21","modified":"2014-10-25","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:tpatel@doitt.nyc.gov"},"keyword":["ccrb","merits","allegations"],"identifier":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/t6g4-rw7k","publisher":{"name":"data.cityofnewyork.us"},"description":"This table represents the rate at which CCRB made findings on the merits","title":"Rate at which the CCRB made findings on the merits","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/t6g4-rw7k/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/t6g4-rw7k/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/t6g4-rw7k/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/t6g4-rw7k/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["City Government"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/tngj-drbu","issued":"2013-06-21","modified":"2014-10-25","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:tpatel@doitt.nyc.gov"},"keyword":["dop","probation","law","contact","justice","programs","cd","community district"],"identifier":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/tngj-drbu","publisher":{"name":"data.cityofnewyork.us"},"description":"The Table representing \"Target Community District Probation Demographic Data\" as of 08/05/2011","title":"Target Community District","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/tngj-drbu/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/tngj-drbu/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/tngj-drbu/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/tngj-drbu/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["City Government"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/wkaa-8g8b","issued":"2013-06-21","modified":"2014-10-25","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:tpatel@doitt.nyc.gov"},"keyword":["department of correction","doc","arrests","inmates","visitor","stabbing","slashing"],"identifier":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/wkaa-8g8b","publisher":{"name":"data.cityofnewyork.us"},"description":"This table contains the statistical record of the Inmate Population.

This dataset consists of TC metrics summarized to several different sets of geographic base layers. The metrics presented in this table are based on 2010 high resolution land cover dataset.\r\n\r\nThe TC Assessment is a top-down approach to analyzing the forest.  Its purpose is to integrate high resolution land cover data with other GIS datasets to produce a set of detailed metrics on the forest that allow decision makers to know how much tree canopy currently exists (termed Existing TC) and amount of land where is it biophysically feasible to establish tree canopy on (termed Possible TC). \r\n\r\nExisting TC is determined by extracting all features classified as tree canopy from a high resolution land cover dataset.  Possible TC is determined by identifying land where canopy could possibly exist.  Possible TC in a GIS context is determined by overlaying high resolution land cover with cadastral and planimetric datasets to include building polygons and road polygons.  \r\n\r\nPossible TC is queried out from this overlay and consists of all land that was not existing canopy, not water, not a building, and not a road.  Possible TC is further divided into two subcategories:  Possible-impervious and Possible-vegetation.  Possible-impervious consists of all impervious land that, through modification, could support tree canopy.  Examples of such features are parking lots, driveways (through overhanging coverage) and playgrounds.  Possible-vegetation consists of all land that is low-lying vegetation, primarily grass or shrubs, which could conceivably be converted to support tree canopy.  Examples of such features include residential lawns and playing fields.  TC metrics do not serve to address the issues of where it is socially desirable or financially feasible to plant trees.  Rather, the TC metrics serve as the basis for beginning to form answers to these questions.   \r\n\r\nTC metrics are presented in the attribute table as both absolute area (in map units) and relative area (percentage of land area) per parcel.  For example, an Existing TC Area (TC_E_A) value of 13,677 and an Existing TC Percentage (TC_E_P) of 21.8 indicate that for the parcel in question the area of Existing TC is 13,677 (in map units) and 21.8% of that feature is tree canopy.   This assessment was completed by the University of Vermont's Spatial Analysis Laboratory with funding from National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council (NUCFAC) and the National Science Fundation (NSF) and in cooperation with the USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station.\r\n\r\nThe TC Assessment protocols were developed by the USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station and the University of Vermont's Spatial Analysis Laboratory in collaboration with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.  TC assessments have been conducted for numerous communities throughout the U.S. where the results have been instrumental in helping to establishing TC goals.","title":"NYC Urban Tree Canopy Assessment Metrics 2010","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/download/hnxz-kkn5/application/zip","mediaType":"application/zip"}],"theme":["Environment"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/9auy-76zt","issued":"2012-06-28","modified":"2014-09-05","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["dpr","landcover","tree","canopy","grass","water","buildings","roads","paved","raster","healthy living","#cleanweb","#education","#environment","bigapps","big apps"],"identifier":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/9auy-76zt","publisher":{"name":"data.cityofnewyork.us"},"description":"High resolution land cover data set for New York City.  This is the 3ft version of the high-resolution land cover dataset for New York City. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces.  The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at 3 square feet. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were the 2010 LiDAR and the 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  Ancillary data sources included GIS data (city boundary, building footprints, water, parking lots, roads, railroads, railroad structures, ballfields) provided by New York City (all ancillary datasets except railroads); UVM Spatial Analysis Laboratory manually created railroad polygons from manual interpretation of 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  The tree canopy class was considered current as of 2010; the remaining land-cover classes were considered current as of 2008. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) techniques were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets.  OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets.  Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process.  A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. More than 35,000 corrections were made to the classification.  Overall accuracy was 96%. This dataset was developed as part of the Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) Assessment for New York City.  As such, it represents a 'top down' mapping perspective in which tree canopy over hanging other features is assigned to the tree canopy class.  At the time of its creation this dataset represents the most detailed and accurate land cover dataset for the area. This project was funded by National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council (NUCFAC) and the National Science Fundation (NSF), although it is not specifically endorsed by either agency.  The methods used were developed by the University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Laboratory, in collaboration with the New York City Urban Field Station, with funding from the USDA Forest Service.","title":"Landcover Raster Data (2010)","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/download/9auy-76zt/application/zip","mediaType":"application/zip"}],"theme":["Environment"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/p23h-ci72","issued":"2012-06-28","modified":"2014-09-05","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["greenstreets","healthy living","dpr"],"identifier":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/p23h-ci72","publisher":{"name":"data.cityofnewyork.us"},"description":"A comprehensive shapefile of all small planted areas defined and maintained as Greenstreets.

Performance Measure (APM) \r\n¶•The New York State Education Department adopted Aspirational Performance Measures (APM) in addition to high school graduation rates for the Cohort of 2006 (Class of 2010). In addition to the numbers of students earning Advanced Regents Designation on their diplomas, another metric was developed based on performance on Math and ELA Regents exams. The Math/ELA APM represents the percentage of students in the cohort who graduated with any regular diploma (Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation, Regents Diploma, or Local Diploma) and who scored 80 or greater on their highest mathematics Regents and 75 or greater on the English Regents. Since this metric is new for the Class of 2010, only one year of results is reported, separately for June and August graduation cohorts. The total number of students in the cohort is the same in June and August. \r\n¶•Records with cohorts of 20 students or less are suppressed. \r\n¶•August outcomes include all June and August graduates. \r\n¶•In school-level reporting, students who were in a school for less than 5 months are not included in the school’s cohort, but are included in citywide totals. \r\n¶•School level results are not presented for District 79 schools, but their outcomes are included in citywide totals. \r\n¶•Schools that had previously obtained a waiver to use alternative assessments (rather than Regents examinations) were omitted from the Math/ELA APM calculations.","title":"Graduation Outcomes - Class Of 2010 - Regents-based Math- ELA APM - School Level","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/k8hv-56d7/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/k8hv-56d7/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/k8hv-56d7/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/k8hv-56d7/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Education"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/vh2h-md7a","issued":"2011-10-18","modified":"2014-10-25","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["lifelong learning"],"identifier":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/vh2h-md7a","publisher":{"name":"data.cityofnewyork.us"},"description":"Graduation Outcomes - Cohorts of 2001 through 2006 (Classes of 2005 through 2010) \r\n¶¶•The New York State calculation method was first adopted for the Cohort of 2001 (Class of 2005).
