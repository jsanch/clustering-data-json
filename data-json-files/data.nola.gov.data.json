As one of the measures designed to offset this adverse effect, FEMA professionally surveyed 7 of New Orleans’ National Register listed historic districts. FEMA also surveyed tens of thousands of properties slated for demolition. In 2011, FEMA surveyed 8 additional districts as a result of a similar statewide agreement offsetting FEMA-funded elevations of residences. These are the results of the surveys, including historical attributes of the surveyed structures, and several photos of each (linked in the attribute table). The data for all of these properties and ownership of this data was handed over to the City of New Orleans and the State of Louisiana. The intent, building off of the discussions during consultation for both of these programmatic agreements and the spirit of the National Historic Preservation Act which encourages all treatment measures to offset adverse to historic properties, is that the City (and State) use this data for public benefit. FEMA does not limit use of this data and encourages any use of this data for public benefit.

The primary purpose of Census Tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. In 1980 the New Orleans City Planning Commission, for planning and decision-making purposes, divided the city into Census Tract based 'neighborhoods'. Additional neighborhoods were created after the 1990 and 2000 Censuses. Following Hurricane Katrina the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center (GNOCDC) settled on these boundaries to facilitate the use of local data in decision-making. These neighborhoods underwent further change during the 2010 Census due to modifications (consolidation and/or splitting) of Census Tracts, the resulting boundaries were renamed as 'Neighborhood Statistical Areas' to reflect their actual function.","title":"NOLA Neighborhood Statistical Areas","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.nola.gov/api/geospatial/ukvx-5dku?method=export&format=KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.nola.gov/api/geospatial/ukvx-5dku?method=export&format=KMZ","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kmz"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.nola.gov/api/geospatial/ukvx-5dku?method=export&format=Shapefile","mediaType":"application/zip"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.nola.gov/api/geospatial/ukvx-5dku?method=export&format=Original","mediaType":"application/zip"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.nola.gov/api/views/ukvx-5dku/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.nola.gov/api/views/ukvx-5dku/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"}],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode","theme":["Geographic Base Layers"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nola.gov/d/ssw4-9pg7","issued":"2013-05-28","modified":"2015-08-25","keyword":["new orleans","planning","place-based"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:data@nola.gov"},"publisher":{"name":"data.nola.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.nola.gov/api/views/ssw4-9pg7","description":"Place-based developing leverages investments by focusing resources in targeted places and drawing on the compounding effect of well-coordinated action.

Place-based policies can also streamline otherwise redundant and disconnected programs and maximize efficiencies of operation and budget.\r\n\r\nThe Direct Homebuyer Assistance Program in New Orleans provides down payment and closing costs subsidies to eligible first- time homebuyers.  The subsidies bridge the gap between the price of the home (including closing costs) and the maximum amount a homebuyer can borrow with a first mortgage loan.  The homebuyer receives only the amount of soft second funding that is needed to close the affordability gap. While all areas of the city are eligible for this program.
