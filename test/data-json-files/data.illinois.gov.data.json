This report presents five-year age interval abridged current life tables.\r\nComputation of an abridged life table from which life expectancy is derived requires\r\nmainly population and death data by age and sex. In this report, population data consist of the\r\n1990, 2000, and 2010 census counts of residents of each Illinois County and the city of Chicago.\r\nThese data were aggregated into five-year age groups and by sex and used as denominators in\r\ncomputing mortality rates.

Projects Managers are not required to oversee asbestos abatement projects in commercial and public buildings, but if a building owner chooses to have an individual oversee the project, then the Department requires that the person be licensed. \r\no\tAir Sampling Professionals are responsible for taking air samples to determine the airborne concentration of asbestos inside and outside the work area. The Air Sampling Professional conducts aggressive clearance air monitoring at the end of asbestos abatement projects to ensure that the concentration of asbestos in the air is acceptable for reoccupation of the area. \r\no\tProject Designers are required to develop project designs for school buildings. The project designers are required to draw up specifications and contracts that contractors must follow to complete an asbestos abatement project that meets state and federal regulations. If a project design is developed for asbestos abatement in commercial and public buildings, then it must be completed by a licensed Project Designer.\r\no\tInspectors are required to identify asbestos-containing materials by sampling suspected asbestos-containing materials discovered during an inspection. \r\no\tManagement Planners are required to develop management plans based upon information from an Inspector. Each school in Illinois must develop and maintain an asbestos management plan describing the management of the school's asbestos-containing building materials.

As actual future population trends are unknown, the projected numbers should not be considered a precise prediction of the future population; rather, these projections, calculated under a specific set of assumptions, indicate the levels of population that would result if our assumptions about each population component (births, deaths and net migration) hold true. The assumptions used in this report, and the details presented below, generally assume a continuation of current trends. Methodology These projections were produced using a demographic cohort-component projection model. In this model, each component of population change – birth, death and net migration – is projected separately for each five-year birth cohort and sex. The cohort – component method employs the following basic demographic balancing equation: P1 = P0 + B – D + NM Where: P1 = Population at the end of the period; P0 = Population at the beginning of the period; B = Resident births during the period; D = Resident deaths during the period; and NM = Net migration (Inmigration – Outmigration) during the period. The model roughly works as follows: for every five-year projection period, the base population, disaggregated by five-year age groups and sex, is “survived” to the next five-year period by applying the appropriate survival rates for each age and sex group; next, net migrants by age and sex are added to the survived population. The population under 5 years of age is generated by applying age specific birth rates to the survived females in childbearing age (15 to 49 years). Base Population These projections began with the July 1, 2010 population estimates by age and sex produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. The most recent census population of April 1, 2010 was the base for July 1, 2010 population estimates. Special Populations In 19 counties, the college dormitory population or adult inmates in correctional facilities accounted for 5 percent or more of the total population of the county; these counties were considered as special counties. There were six college dorm counties (Champaign, Coles, DeKalb, Jackson, McDonough and McLean) and 13 correctional facilities counties (Bond, Brown, Crawford, Fayette, Fulton, Jefferson, Johnson, Lawrence, Lee, Logan, Montgomery, Perry and Randolph) that qualified as special counties. When projecting the population, these special populations were first subtracted from the base populations for each special county; then they were added back to the projected population to produce the total population projections by age and sex. The base special population by age and sex from the 2010 population census was used for this purpose with the assumption that this population will remain the same throughout each projection period. Mortality Future deaths were projected by applying age and sex specific survival rates to each age and sex specific base population. The assumptions on survival rates were developed on the basis of trends of mortality rates in the individual life tables constructed for each level of geography for 1989-1991, 1999-2001 and 2009-2011. The application of five-year survival rates provides a projection of the number of persons from the initial population expected to be alive in five years. Resident deaths data by age and sex from 1989 to 2011 were provided by the Illinois Center for Health Statistics (ICHS), Illinois Department of Public Health. Fertility Total fertility rates (TFRs) were first computed for each county. For most counties, the projected 2015 TFRs were computed as the average of the 2000 and 2010 TFRs. 2010 or 2015 rates were retained for 2020 projections, depending on the birth trend of each county. The age-specific birth rates (ASBR) were next computed for each county by multiplying the 2010 ASBR by each projected TFR. Total births were then projected for each county by applying age-specific birth rates to the projected female population of reproductive ages (15 to 49 years). The total births were broken down by sex, using an assumed sex-ratio at birth. These births were survived five years applying assumed survival ratios to get the projected population for the age group 0-4. For the special counties, special populations by age and sex were taken out before computing age-specific birth rates. The resident birth data used to compute age-specific birth rates for 1989-1991, 1999-2001 and 2009-2011 came from ICHS. Births to females younger than 15 years of age were added to those of the 15-19 age group and births to women older than 49 years of age were added to the 45-49 age group. Net Migration Migration is the major component of population change in Illinois, Chicago and Illinois counties. The state is experiencing a significant loss of population through internal (domestic migration within the U.S.) net migration. Unlike data on births and deaths, migration data based on administrative records are not available on a regular basis. Most data on migration are collected through surveys or indirectly from administrative records (IRS individual tax returns). For this report, net migration trends have been reviewed using data from different sources and methods (such as residual method) from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Illinois Department of Public Health, individual exemptions data from the Internal Revenue Service, and survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau. On the basis of knowledge gained through this review and of levels of net migration from different sources, assumptions have been made that Illinois will have annual net migrants of -40, 000, -35,000 and -30,000 during 2010-2015, 2015-2020 and 2020-2025, respectively. These figures have been distributed among the counties, using age and sex distribution of net migrants during 1995-2000. The 2000 population census was the last decennial census, which included the question “Where did you live five years ago?” The age and sex distribution of the net migrants was derived, using answers to this question. The net migration for Chicago has been derived independently, using census survival method for 1990-2000 and 2000-2010 under the assumption that the annual net migration for Chicago will be -40,000, -30,000 and -25,000 for 2010-2015, 2015-2020 and 2020-2025, respectively. The age and sex distribution from the 2000-2010 net migration was used to distribute the net migrants for the projection periods. Conclusion These projections were prepared for use by the Certificate of Need (CON) Program; they are produced using evidence-based techniques, reasonable assumptions and the best available input data. However, as assumptions of future demographic trends may contain errors, the resulting projections are unlikely to be free of errors. In general, projections of small areas are less reliable than those for larger areas, and the farther in the future projections are made, the less reliable they may become. When possible, these projections should be regularly reviewed and updated, using more recent birth, death and migration data.","title":"IDPH Population Projections For Illinois By Age And Sex 2010 To 2025","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/5m4f-swbm/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/5m4f-swbm/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/5m4f-swbm/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/5m4f-swbm/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.illinois.gov/d/6u8g-w2b6","issued":"2015-04-14","modified":"2015-06-29","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["idph","population","projections","estimates"],"identifier":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/6u8g-w2b6","publisher":{"name":"data.illinois.gov"},"description":"Introduction\r\n\r\nThis report presents projections of population from 2015 to 2025 by age and sex for Illinois, Chicago and Illinois counties produced for the Certificate of Need (CON) Program. \r\nAs actual future population trends are unknown, the projected numbers should not be considered a precise prediction of the future population; rather, these projections, calculated under a specific set of assumptions, indicate the levels of population that would result if our assumptions about each population component (births, deaths and net migration) hold true.

As actual future population trends are unknown, the projected numbers should not be considered a precise prediction of the future population; rather, these projections, calculated under a specific set of assumptions, indicate the levels of population that would result if our assumptions about each population component (births, deaths and net migration) hold true. The assumptions used in this report, and the details presented below, generally assume a continuation of current trends. Methodology These projections were produced using a demographic cohort-component projection model. In this model, each component of population change – birth, death and net migration – is projected separately for each five-year birth cohort and sex. The cohort – component method employs the following basic demographic balancing equation: P1 = P0 + B – D + NM Where: P1 = Population at the end of the period; P0 = Population at the beginning of the period; B = Resident births during the period; D = Resident deaths during the period; and NM = Net migration (Inmigration – Outmigration) during the period. The model roughly works as follows: for every five-year projection period, the base population, disaggregated by five-year age groups and sex, is “survived” to the next five-year period by applying the appropriate survival rates for each age and sex group; next, net migrants by age and sex are added to the survived population. The population under 5 years of age is generated by applying age specific birth rates to the survived females in childbearing age (15 to 49 years). Base Population These projections began with the July 1, 2010 population estimates by age and sex produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. The most recent census population of April 1, 2010 was the base for July 1, 2010 population estimates. Special Populations In 19 counties, the college dormitory population or adult inmates in correctional facilities accounted for 5 percent or more of the total population of the county; these counties were considered as special counties. There were six college dorm counties (Champaign, Coles, DeKalb, Jackson, McDonough and McLean) and 13 correctional facilities counties (Bond, Brown, Crawford, Fayette, Fulton, Jefferson, Johnson, Lawrence, Lee, Logan, Montgomery, Perry and Randolph) that qualified as special counties. When projecting the population, these special populations were first subtracted from the base populations for each special county; then they were added back to the projected population to produce the total population projections by age and sex. The base special population by age and sex from the 2010 population census was used for this purpose with the assumption that this population will remain the same throughout each projection period. Mortality Future deaths were projected by applying age and sex specific survival rates to each age and sex specific base population. The assumptions on survival rates were developed on the basis of trends of mortality rates in the individual life tables constructed for each level of geography for 1989-1991, 1999-2001 and 2009-2011. The application of five-year survival rates provides a projection of the number of persons from the initial population expected to be alive in five years. Resident deaths data by age and sex from 1989 to 2011 were provided by the Illinois Center for Health Statistics (ICHS), Illinois Department of Public Health. Fertility Total fertility rates (TFRs) were first computed for each county. For most counties, the projected 2015 TFRs were computed as the average of the 2000 and 2010 TFRs. 2010 or 2015 rates were retained for 2020 projections, depending on the birth trend of each county. The age-specific birth rates (ASBR) were next computed for each county by multiplying the 2010 ASBR by each projected TFR. Total births were then projected for each county by applying age-specific birth rates to the projected female population of reproductive ages (15 to 49 years). The total births were broken down by sex, using an assumed sex-ratio at birth. These births were survived five years applying assumed survival ratios to get the projected population for the age group 0-4. For the special counties, special populations by age and sex were taken out before computing age-specific birth rates. The resident birth data used to compute age-specific birth rates for 1989-1991, 1999-2001 and 2009-2011 came from ICHS. Births to females younger than 15 years of age were added to those of the 15-19 age group and births to women older than 49 years of age were added to the 45-49 age group. Net Migration Migration is the major component of population change in Illinois, Chicago and Illinois counties. The state is experiencing a significant loss of population through internal (domestic migration within the U.S.) net migration. Unlike data on births and deaths, migration data based on administrative records are not available on a regular basis. Most data on migration are collected through surveys or indirectly from administrative records (IRS individual tax returns). For this report, net migration trends have been reviewed using data from different sources and methods (such as residual method) from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Illinois Department of Public Health, individual exemptions data from the Internal Revenue Service, and survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau. On the basis of knowledge gained through this review and of levels of net migration from different sources, assumptions have been made that Illinois will have annual net migrants of -40, 000, -35,000 and -30,000 during 2010-2015, 2015-2020 and 2020-2025, respectively. These figures have been distributed among the counties, using age and sex distribution of net migrants during 1995-2000. The 2000 population census was the last decennial census, which included the question “Where did you live five years ago?” The age and sex distribution of the net migrants was derived, using answers to this question. The net migration for Chicago has been derived independently, using census survival method for 1990-2000 and 2000-2010 under the assumption that the annual net migration for Chicago will be -40,000, -30,000 and -25,000 for 2010-2015, 2015-2020 and 2020-2025, respectively. The age and sex distribution from the 2000-2010 net migration was used to distribute the net migrants for the projection periods. Conclusion These projections were prepared for use by the Certificate of Need (CON) Program; they are produced using evidence-based techniques, reasonable assumptions and the best available input data. However, as assumptions of future demographic trends may contain errors, the resulting projections are unlikely to be free of errors. In general, projections of small areas are less reliable than those for larger areas, and the farther in the future projections are made, the less reliable they may become. When possible, these projections should be regularly reviewed and updated, using more recent birth, death and migration data.","title":"IDPH Population Projections For Illinois Counties 2010 To 2025","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/ntyz-weef/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/ntyz-weef/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/ntyz-weef/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/ntyz-weef/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.illinois.gov/d/hqm8-38sz","issued":"2015-04-13","modified":"2015-06-29","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["idph","estimates","population","projections","age","sex"],"identifier":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/hqm8-38sz","publisher":{"name":"data.illinois.gov"},"description":"Introduction This report presents projections of population from 2015 to 2025 by age and sex for Illinois, Chicago and Illinois counties produced for the Certificate of Need (CON) Program.

Based on 9 1/2 months of reported data.\n1985-1986: Since the Illinois Department of Public Health was prohibited from mandating abortion reporting by a temporary restraining order issued in 1984, these numbers were generated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from voluntary reports submitted by Illinois abortion facilities.\n1987-1992: In 1987, CDC turned over the annual voluntary survey of facilities performing abortions to the Department.\n1993: No data was collected.\n1994: A settlement to the 1984 temporary restraining order was reached in the fall of 1993 that allowed Illinois to resume mandatory reporting of abortions. In May 1994, health care providers were notified of the settlement and the Department outlined reporting requirements, including instructions that information on all procedures from Jan. 1, 1994 on be submitted. However, since only about 1,000 abortion reports were received for the first four months of the year, data for 1994 should be considered incomplete.\nData was last updated on November 5,

Influenza, commonly called \"the flu,\" is an infection of the respiratory tract caused by the influenza virus. Compared with most viral respiratory infections, such as the common cold, influenza infection often causes a more severe illness. Typical influenza illness includes fever (usually 100 degrees F to 103 degrees F in adults and often even higher in children) and respiratory symptoms, such as cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, as well as headache, muscle aches and extreme fatigue. Although nausea, vomiting and diarrhea can sometimes accompany influenza infection, especially in children, these symptoms are rarely the primary symptoms. The term \"stomach flu\" is a misnomer that is sometimes used to describe gastrointestinal illnesses caused by organisms other than influenza viruses. During most flu seasons, which typically run from November to April, between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population is infected with influenza viruses. Most people who get the flu recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people develop serious and potentially life-threatening medical complications, such as pneumonia. Flu-related complications can occur at any age, but the elderly and people with chronic health problems are much more likely to develop serious complications after influenza infection than are young, healthier people. Since 2010, IDPH has collected information about influenza cases that required Intensive Care Unit (ICU) hospitalization as a way to measure the severity of disease.","title":"10to12 Iquery Flu Data","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/8kzf-xyr7/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/8kzf-xyr7/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/8kzf-xyr7/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/8kzf-xyr7/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.illinois.gov/d/9nr5-bsgm","issued":"2013-11-06","modified":"2014-10-30","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"identifier":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/9nr5-bsgm","publisher":{"name":"data.illinois.gov"},"description":"Varicella (Chickenpox), a highly contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus, is one of the most commonly reported childhood diseases.

Federal Older American's Act regulations, the Illinois Department on Aging has divided Illinois into 13 Planning and Service Areas (PSAs).\r\n\r\nThe 13 Planning and Service Areas in Illinois are each managed and served by an Area Agency on Aging. The Department works in partnership with these agencies: 12 not-for-profit corporations and one unit of local government, the City of Chicago.\r\n\r\nArea Agencies have the primary task of planning and coordinating services and programs for older people in their respective areas. The Area Agencies receive funding from the Department based on a formula which takes into consideration the number of older citizens and minorities in that area, as well as the number living in poverty, in rural areas, and alone. \r\n\r\nLike the Department on Aging, Area Agencies are not, as a rule, direct service providers. Area Agencies contract with local agencies which provide services to the older people who live in the same community.","title":"IDOA - Area Agencies on Aging","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/6bgh-ttez/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/6bgh-ttez/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/6bgh-ttez/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/6bgh-ttez/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Social/Healthcare"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.illinois.gov/d/r7fq-24ug","issued":"2011-10-21","modified":"2014-10-30","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["disaster","declaration","federal","fema","county"],"identifier":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/r7fq-24ug","publisher":{"name":"data.illinois.gov"},"description":"A list of Federally Declared Disaster by Illinois County since 1965.","title":"IEMA Federal Disaster Declarations by County","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/r7fq-24ug/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/r7fq-24ug/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/r7fq-24ug/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/r7fq-24ug/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Reference"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.illinois.gov/d/s296-ttzm","issued":"2011-10-21","modified":"2014-10-30","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["hazardous","materials","chemicals","hazmat","spills"],"identifier":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/s296-ttzm","publisher":{"name":"data.illinois.gov"},"description":"A list of reports taken by IEMA of Hazardous Material spills in Illinois","title":"IEMA Hazardous Material Spills","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/s296-ttzm/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/s296-ttzm/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/s296-ttzm/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/s296-ttzm/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Environment"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.illinois.gov/d/2kz4-t22j","issued":"2011-09-30","modified":"2014-10-29","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:Michelle.Bentley@illinois.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/2kz4-t22j","publisher":{"name":"data.illinois.gov"},"description":"Data extracted from the Bureau of Land's Leaking Underground Storage Tank Incident (LIT) Database.
