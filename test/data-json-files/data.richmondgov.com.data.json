This zone primarily covered areas in the Downtown area and commercial and industrial properties north of the James River and west of I-95. At that time a portion of residential parcels was included. Eight (8) years later, Henrico County and the City of Richmond  applied for a Joint Zone (connecting at Broad Street and Brook Road). At that time, the original 20-year zone time was retained. The Joint Zone (Zone III/formerly North Zone) had a sunset date of December 31, 2014. In 2012, Henrico County contacted the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) requesting that they be allowed 20 years for Zone III as a joint zone resulting in a sunset date of December 31, 2022. At the end of 2014, both the City and Henrico County applied for a Redesignation of Zone III from DHCD; the Redesignation application was approved in January of 2015 by the Virginia Commonwealth resulting in an extension of Zone III for both the City and Henrico County. The official sunset date was set at December 31, 2022.\r\n\r\nContentwise, the Redesignated Zone III encompasses the commercial and industrial areas north of the James River including and west of I-95. Also, commercial corridors north of the James River and east of I-95 are included as well as Shockoe Bottom. Lastly, the Hull Street and Hull Street Road Corridors, Belt Boulevard between Hull Street Road and Midlothian Turnpike and Midlothian Turnpike corridor between the City line and Belt Boulevard are incorporated.","title":"Enterprise Zones","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/geospatial/wive-3qc7?method=export&format=KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/geospatial/wive-3qc7?method=export&format=KMZ","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kmz"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/geospatial/wive-3qc7?method=export&format=Shapefile","mediaType":"application/zip"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/geospatial/wive-3qc7?method=export&format=Original","mediaType":"application/zip"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/views/wive-3qc7/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/views/wive-3qc7/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"}],"theme":["Economic Growth"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.richmondgov.com/d/jef5-qqij","issued":"2015-06-25","modified":"2015-06-25","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:Lisbeth.Coker@richmondgov.com"},"keyword":["economic","care"],"identifier":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/views/jef5-qqij","publisher":{"name":"data.richmondgov.com"},"description":"Commercial Area Revitalization Effort (CARE).

system of trails that are used for biking and hiking were initially captured using GPS techniques by the Bicycle, Pedestrian and Trails Coordinator, Department of Parks & Recreation, along with friends of the mountain biking community. Trails were captured by physically riding a bike along these pathways. Inaccuracies of GPS data resulting from riding under tree canopies and from use of less-than-survey-accurate GPS devices were 'corrected' by City GIS staff (geographic information systems) by adjusting the trails to overlay identifiable features from the City's orthophotography. For example, the dirt of worn single-track pathways could be seen in less dense foliage and field areas. In many cases there was no way to see through the more densely forested areas, so the original GPS'ed information was not interpreted to match the orthophotography. It is believed that all trails and waypoints data meet the map accuracy standards required of the Department of Parks and Recreation.All final decisions about the mapped locations and attribution of Waypoints and Trails were under the purview of the City's trails superintendant.","title":"Trails","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/geospatial/3kbj-ypat?method=export&format=KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/geospatial/3kbj-ypat?method=export&format=KMZ","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kmz"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/geospatial/3kbj-ypat?method=export&format=Shapefile","mediaType":"application/zip"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/geospatial/3kbj-ypat?method=export&format=Original","mediaType":"application/zip"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/views/3kbj-ypat/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/views/3kbj-ypat/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"}],"theme":["Sustainability and Natural Environment"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.richmondgov.com/d/tddt-q3bd","issued":"2014-09-11","modified":"2015-06-25","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:Richard.Morton@richmondgov.com"},"keyword":["neighborhood","statistical","nsa"],"identifier":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/views/tddt-q3bd","publisher":{"name":"data.richmondgov.com"},"description":"The City needed geographical area definitions that were homogenous and non-political. The preexisting Neighborhoods feature class was defined to maintain homogenous areas of the City, but they were determined to be too discrete and numerous. Pertaining to size as well, it was believed that the geographical areas should not be so large, as to group together areas of the City that were dissimilar in character. Of particular importance, it was also a requirement that NSA geography was designed to permit analysis using Census data.\r\n\r\nIt was decided by the Planning Dept that adhering to Census Block Groups was the best approach. It was also determined that attempts to approximate the Planning Districts would also be beneficial. The approach to defining the NSAs was as follows: a) 2010 Census Block Groups were merged together to create each individual NSA, b) they were grouped in ways to maximize the ability to share boundaries with existing Planning Districts were ever possible. While most NSAs lie almost entirely within one Planning District, some NSAs are pretty equally split between two planning districts (notably D-1). In the case of D-1, PDR arbitrarily decided to put it with the other ‘Downtown’ NSAs.\r\n\r\nThe identification/naming of the NSAs was based upon the Planning Districts they most corresponded to, along with a sequential numbering assignment. Most NSA lie almost entirely within one Planning District, and where named from that Planning District. Names starting with \"NO\" are mostly in the North planning district; \"NW\" are mostly in the Near West planning district; \"BR\" are mostly in the Broad Rock planning district, etc... There’s no significance for the number following the planning district lettering used by NSAs (NO-1, NO-2, NO-3, etc). The number was just randomly assigned to further uniquely define the area subdivided within the Planning District, and has no relationship in terms to square area, population density, or anything.","title":"Neighborhood Statistical Areas","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/geospatial/tddt-q3bd?method=export&format=KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/geospatial/tddt-q3bd?method=export&format=KMZ","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kmz"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/geospatial/tddt-q3bd?method=export&format=Shapefile","mediaType":"application/zip"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/geospatial/tddt-q3bd?method=export&format=Original","mediaType":"application/zip"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/views/tddt-q3bd/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/views/tddt-q3bd/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"}],"theme":["Well-Managed Government"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.richmondgov.com/d/e9k6-65id","issued":"2014-09-11","modified":"2014-09-11","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:Richard.Morton@richmondgov.com"},"keyword":["neighborhoods"],"identifier":"https://data.richmondgov.com/api/views/e9k6-65id","publisher":{"name":"data.richmondgov.com"},"description":"The Neighborhoods feature class layer describes boundaries of community neighborhoods within the City of Richmond.
