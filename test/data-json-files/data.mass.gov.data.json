For communities with a coastal boundary, MassGIS has collaborated with Massachusetts Water Resources Authority and the Department of Environmental Protection to complete a 1:12000 scale coastline. The boundary for the coastline was defined as being the upland side of tidal flats and rocky inter-tidal zones. Note that the 351 communities are the official municipal names, not including \"villages\" or other sections of towns.","title":"Massachusetts Municipalities","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.mass.gov/api/views/ybti-pdkk/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.mass.gov/api/views/ybti-pdkk/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.mass.gov/api/views/ybti-pdkk/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.mass.gov/api/views/ybti-pdkk/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["State Government"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.mass.gov/d/ttpd-cp2f","issued":"2014-10-08","modified":"2015-01-07","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:developer@mbta.com"},"keyword":["mbta","transportation","transit","routes","services","ridership","vehicles","infrastructure"],"identifier":"https://data.mass.gov/api/views/ttpd-cp2f","publisher":{"name":"data.mass.gov"},"description":"Also known as \"the Blue Book.\" A wealth of information and statistics about MBTA routes, services, ridership, vehicles, infrastructure, and more.","title":"MBTA Ridership and Service Statistics","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"http://www.mbta.com/bluebook","mediaType":"web"}],"theme":["Transportation"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.mass.gov/d/pw47-sjdi","issued":"2014-10-08","modified":"2015-01-07","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:developer@mbta.com"},"keyword":["mbta","transportation","transit","realtime","gtfs","gtfs-realtime","schedule","alert","bus","subway","commuter rail","api","rss"],"identifier":"https://data.mass.gov/api/views/pw47-sjdi","publisher":{"name":"data.mass.gov"},"description":"MBTA-realtime is the MBTA's premier alert and real-time information interface for third-party developers.
