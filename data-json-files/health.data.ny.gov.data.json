Active food service establishments include only establishments that are currently operating.  This dataset excludes inspections conducted in New York City (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Restaurant-Inspection-Results/4vkw-7nck), Suffolk County (http://apps.suffolkcountyny.gov/health/Restaurant/intro.html) and Erie County (http://www.healthspace.com/erieny). Inspections are a “snapshot” in time and are not always reflective of the day-to-day operations and overall condition of an establishment. Occasionally, remediation may not appear until the following month due to the timing of the updates. Update frequencies and availability of historical inspection data may vary from county to county. Some counties provide this information on their own websites and information found there may be updated more frequently. This dataset is refreshed on a monthly basis. The inspection data contained in this dataset was not collected in a manner intended for use as a restaurant grading system, and should not be construed or interpreted as such. Any use of this data to develop a restaurant grading system is not supported or endorsed by the New York State Department of Health. Historical inspection data through 2005 is also available. Inactive (closed) establishments can be found at: https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Food-Service-Establishment-Inspections-Beginning-2/aaxz-j6pj.

Although the overall number of respondents in the BRFSS is more than sufficiently large for statistical inference purposes, subgroup analyses can lead to estimates that are unreliable. Interpreting and reporting weighted numbers that are based on a small, unweighted number of respondents can mislead the reader into believing that a given finding is much more precise than it actually is. The BRFSS follows a rule of not reporting or interpreting percentages based upon a denominator of fewer than 50 respondents (unweighted sample). Both a csv and sas data files are available.
