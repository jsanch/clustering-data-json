The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide, continuous survey designed to provide communities with reliable and timely demographic, housing, social and economic data. The ACS replaces the decennial census long form in 2010 and every year thereafter.
The annual ACS sample is smaller than that of previous long form surveys resulting in a larger sampling error. Coefficients of Variation (CVs), which are statistical measures that show the relative amount of sampling error associated with an estimate, are presented here as a measure of reliability and usability of the data.
One unit of geography used for the 2009-2013 data is the census tract - a small statistical area within a county, which is delineated every 10 years prior to the decennial census.

The other unit of geography used for the 2009-2013 data is the Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA). ZCTAs are statistical geographic areas produced by the Census Bureau by aggregating census blocks to create generalized areas closely resembling the U.S. Postal Service's postal zip codes.

MD iMAP: ZIP Code Tabulation Areas - ZCTAs,5,"This is a MD iMAP hosted service.  Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov 
The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.


ZCTAs are statistical geographic areas produced by the Census Bureau by aggregating census blocks to create generalized areas closely resembling the U.S. Postal Service's postal zip codes.

The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on a given Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital Flood Insurance Study (FIS) database that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS. This map service is a composite of Effective and Preliminary floodplain data. Q3 data is used where neither Effective or Preliminary data is available for a given community.
The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual- chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000.

MD iMAP: Maryland Broadband Providers Per Census Block,18,"This is a MD iMAP hosted service.  Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov 
The service depicts the number of broadband service providers per census block and the layer represents the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) State Broadband Data Development Program (SBDD) area of broadband availability. The number of broadband providers per census block is illustrated. Area of broadband availability refers to those individual US Census Blocks, less than 2 square miles, where each facilities-based provider of broadband service can provide broadband services of minimal characteristics within 7 - 10 business days. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is the provision, on either a commercial or non-commercial basis, of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose, an 'end user' of broadband service is a residential or business party, institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not 'end users' for this purpose. An entity is a 'facilities based' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs), special access lines, or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is 'available' at an address if the provider does, or could, within a typical service interval (7 to 10 business days) without an extraordinary commitment of resources, provision two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end-users at that address.

This is an archived service. The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide, continuous survey designed to provide communities with reliable and timely demographic, housing, social and economic data. The ACS replaces the decennial census long form in 2010 and every year thereafter.
The annual ACS sample is smaller than that of previous long form surveys resulting in a larger sampling error. Coefficients of Variation (CVs), which are statistical measures that show the relative amount of sampling error associated with an estimate, are presented here as a measure of reliability and usability of the data.

The unit of geography used for the 2008-2012 data is the census tract - a small statistical area within a county, which is delineated every 10 years prior to the decennial census.

The Maryland Inventory of Historic Properties is a research and documentation instrument that serves as an archive of information to further the understanding of the State’s architectural, archeological, and cultural resources. To date, the MIHP is comprised of nearly 90,000 resources, composed of archaeological sites, building, structures, objects and survey districts. A Maryland Inventory form provides a description of historic resource and discusses its history, but the MIHP is not a regulatory instrument, and the determination of a resource’s historic significance is not a requirement for inclusion. Maryland State law provides elsewhere for mechanisms – separate from the MIHP – giving both the State and local jurisdictions the authority to regulate appropriately designated historic resources. The Maryland Inventory should not be confused with the National Register of Historic Places, the Maryland Register of Historic Properties, or local lists of locally designated historic resources, although resources listed in all of the above categories are included in the Maryland Inventory.

The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.


ZCTAs are statistical geographic areas produced by the Census Bureau by aggregating census blocks to create generalized areas closely resembling the U.S. Postal Service's postal zip codes.

The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital Flood Insurance Study (FIS) database that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS. This map service is a composite of Effective and Preliminary floodplain data. Q3 data is used where neither Effective or Preliminary data is available for a given community.
The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual- chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000.

MD iMAP: Urban Areas 2010,5,"This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov 
The TIGER/Line Files include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities). An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always nest within a State, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the State in which they are located. The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with State, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing and population. The boundaries of all 2010 Census incorporated places are as of January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The boundaries of all 2010 Census CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).
After each decennial census, the Census Bureau delineates urban areas that represent densely developed territory, encompassing residential, commercial, and other nonresidential urban land uses. In general, this territory consists of areas of high population density and urban land use resulting in a representation of the ""urban footprint."" There are two types of urban areas: urbanized areas (UAs) that contain 50,000 or more people and urban clusters (UCs) that contain at least 2,500 people, but fewer than 50,000 people (except in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam which each contain urban clusters with populations greater than 50,000). Each urban area is identified by a 5-character numeric census code that may contain leading zeroes.

The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on a given Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital Flood Insurance Study (FIS) database that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS. This map service is a composite of Effective and Preliminary floodplain data. Q3 data is used where neither Effective or Preliminary data is available for a given community.
The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual- chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000.

MD iMAP: Census Designated Places 2010,5,"This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov 
The TIGER/Line Files include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities). An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always nest within a State, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the State in which they are located. The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with State, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing and population. The boundaries of all 2010 Census incorporated places are as of January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The boundaries of all 2010 Census CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).
After each decennial census, the Census Bureau delineates urban areas that represent densely developed territory, encompassing residential, commercial, and other nonresidential urban land uses. In general, this territory consists of areas of high population density and urban land use resulting in a representation of the ""urban footprint."" There are two types of urban areas: urbanized areas (UAs) that contain 50,000 or more people and urban clusters (UCs) that contain at least 2,500 people, but fewer than 50,000 people (except in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam which each contain urban clusters with populations greater than 50,000). Each urban area is identified by a 5-character numeric census code that may contain leading zeroes.

MD iMAP: Census Blocks 2010,5,"This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov 
 Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas. Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census.
Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. Census 2010 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). 

The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of non-contiguous areas.

MD iMAP: All Wireline Provider Coverage,18,"This is a MD iMAP hosted service.  Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov 
This service depicts broadband provider coverage areas in Maryland and the service represents the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) State Broadband Data Development Program (SBDD) area of broadband availability. Area of broadband availability refers to those individual US Census Blocks, less than 2 square miles, where each facilities-based provider of broadband service can provide broadband services of minimal characteristics within 7 - 10 business days. For each area (e.g. census block less than 2 square miles) the provider name and technology they provide there are represented. In addition, advertised and typical upload and download speeds are often reported at these levels. If a provider offers availability to any location within a census block less than 2 square miles, the entire block is deemed available under this effort. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is the provision, on either a commercial or non-commercial basis, of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose, an 'end user' of broadband service is a residential or business party, institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not 'end users' for this purpose. An entity is a 'facilities based' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs), special access lines, or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is 'available' at an address if the provider does, or could, within a typical service interval (7 to 10 business days) without an extraordinary commitment of resources, provision two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end-users at that address.

MD iMAP: Cable Modem Provider Coverage,18,"This is a MD iMAP hosted service.  Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov 
This service depicts broadband provider coverage areas in Maryland and the service represents the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) State Broadband Data Development Program (SBDD) area of broadband availability. Area of broadband availability refers to those individual US Census Blocks, less than 2 square miles, where each facilities-based provider of broadband service can provide broadband services of minimal characteristics within 7 - 10 business days. For each area (e.g. census block less than 2 square miles) the provider name and technology they provide there are represented. In addition, advertised and typical upload and download speeds are often reported at these levels. If a provider offers availability to any location within a census block less than 2 square miles, the entire block is deemed available under this effort. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is the provision, on either a commercial or non-commercial basis, of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose, an 'end user' of broadband service is a residential or business party, institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not 'end users' for this purpose. An entity is a 'facilities based' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs), special access lines, or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is 'available' at an address if the provider does, or could, within a typical service interval (7 to 10 business days) without an extraordinary commitment of resources, provision two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end-users at that address.

'Community Anchor Institutions' consist of schools, libraries, medical and healthcare providers, public safety entities, community colleges and other institutions of higher education, and other community support organizations and entities. 
These locations may not offer broadband availability to the public (although most libraries and many schools, and community centers do) but rather offer an opportunity for policy makers to understand where community anchor institutions who have broadband access are which can help in identifying challenges and opportunities to reaching national connectivity goals. The FCC has a statutory obligation to ensure that schools, libraries, and health care providers have access to advanced telecommunications and information services. In the USF/ICC Transformation Order, the Commission established a performance goal of ensuring ""universal availability of modern networks capable of delivering broadband and voice services . . . to community anchor institutions.""

MD iMAP: Census Tracts 2010,5,"This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov 
 Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas. Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census.
Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. Census 2010 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). 

The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of non-contiguous areas.

MD iMAP: Fixed Wireless Provider Coverage,18,"This is a MD iMAP hosted service.  Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov 
This service depicts broadband provider coverage areas in Maryland and the service represents the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) State Broadband Data Development Program (SBDD) area of broadband availability. Area of broadband availability refers to those individual US Census Blocks, less than 2 square miles, where each facilities-based provider of broadband service can provide broadband services of minimal characteristics within 7 - 10 business days. For each area (e.g. census block less than 2 square miles) the provider name and technology they provide there are represented. In addition, advertised and typical upload and download speeds are often reported at these levels. If a provider offers availability to any location within a census block less than 2 square miles, the entire block is deemed available under this effort. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is the provision, on either a commercial or non-commercial basis, of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose, an 'end user' of broadband service is a residential or business party, institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not 'end users' for this purpose. An entity is a 'facilities based' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs), special access lines, or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is 'available' at an address if the provider does, or could, within a typical service interval (7 to 10 business days) without an extraordinary commitment of resources, provision two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end-users at that address.

This layer represents the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) State Broadband Data Development Program (SBDD) Community Anchor Institutions (CAI) which subscribe to broadband. 'Community Anchor Institutions' consist of schools, libraries, medical and healthcare providers, public safety entities, community colleges and other institutions of higher education, and other community support organizations and entities. These locations may not offer broadband availability to the public (although most libraries and many schools, and community centers do) but rather offer an opportunity for policy makers to understand where community anchor institutions who have broadband access are which can help in identifying challenges and opportunities to reaching national connectivity goals. The FCC has a statutory obligation to ensure that schools, libraries, and health care providers have access to advanced telecommunications and information services. In the USF/ICC Transformation Order, the Commission established a performance goal of ensuring ""universal availability of modern networks capable of delivering broadband and voice services . . . to community anchor institutions.""

For this purpose, 'broadband service' is the provision, on either a commercial or non-commercial basis, of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose, an 'end user' of broadband service is a residential or business party, institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not 'end users' for this purpose. An entity is a 'facilities based' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs), special access lines, or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is 'available' at an address if the provider does, or could, within a typical service interval (7 to 10 business days) without an extraordinary commitment of resources, provision two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end-users at that address.

Projected emissions under a ""business as usual"" scenario were estimated based on the 2006 inventory, projected forward using a protocol set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The business as usual estimates were revised due to changes in the economy since the protocol was set out.  It is important to bear in mind that a BAU projected emissions inventory is a forecast that may, or may not, prove to be an entirely accurate predictor of future emissions. 

Annual actual emission estimates were calculated for the intervening years from 2006 through 2011 by utilizing three surrogates as indicators of emissions (energy, transportation and residential, commercial and industrial fuel combustion).  These three sectors account for over 85 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Maryland.","reported, year, 's, facility, funding, programs"

MTA Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Data,1,"*** DISCLAIMER - This web page is a public resource of general information. The Maryland Mass Transit Administration (MTA) makes no warranty, representation, or guarantee as to the content, sequence, accuracy, timeliness, or completeness of any of the spatial data or database information provided herein. MTA and partner state, local, and other agencies shall assume no liability for errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in the information provided regardless of how caused; or any decision made or action taken or not taken by any person relying on any information or data furnished within. ***

This dataset assesses rail station potential for different forms of transit oriented development (TOD). A key driver of increased transit ridership in Maryland, TOD capitalizes on existing rapid transit infrastructure. The online tool focuses on the MTA’s existing MARC Commuter Rail, Metro Subway, and Central Light Rail lines and includes information specific to each station. 

The goal of this dataset is to give MTA planning staff, developers, local governments, and transit riders a picture of how each MTA rail station could attract TOD investment. In order to make this assessment, MTA staff gathered data on characteristics that are likely to influence TOD potential. The station-specific data is organized into 6 different categories referring to transit activity; station facilities; parking provision and utilization; bicycle and pedestrian access; and local zoning and land availability around each station. 

As a publicly shared resource, this dataset can be used by local communities to identify and prioritize area improvements in coordination with the MTA that can help attract investment around rail stations.

You can view an interactive version of this dataset at geodata.md.gov/tod.

 ** Ridership is calculated the following ways:
Metro Rail ridership is based on Metro gate exit counts.
Light Rail ridership is estimated using a statistical sampling process in line with FTA established guidelines, and approved by the FTA.
MARC ridership is calculated using two (2) independent methods:
Monthly Line level ridership is estimated using a statistical sampling process in line with FTA established guidelines, and approved by the FTA. This method of ridership calculation is used by the MTA for official reporting purposes to State level and Federal level reporting.
Station level ridership is estimated by using person counts completed by the third party vendor. This method of calculation has not been verified by the FTA for statistical reporting and is used for scheduling purposes only. However, because of the granularity of detail, this information is useful for TOD applications.
*Please note that the monthly level ridership and the station level ridership are calculated using two (2) independent methods that are not interchangeable and should not be compared for analysis purposes.","reported, year, 's, facility, funding, programs"

Community Development Block Grant Awards (CDBG),1,"Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds help strengthen Maryland’s communities by expanding affordable housing opportunities, creating jobs, stabilizing neighborhoods, and improving overall quality of life. Congress created the Community Development Block Grant Program under Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The primary objective is to develop viable communities, provide decent housing and a suitable living environment, and to expand economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) oversees the Program. The CDBG Program is comprised of two parts. The Entitlement Program is directly administered by HUD and provides Federal funds to large metropolitan ""entitlement"" communities. The States and Small Cities Program provides Federal funds to the States and Puerto Rico (with the exception of Hawaii) who then distribute funds to ""non-entitlement"" counties, small cities and towns. Congress allocates funds to the program annually. The Entitlement Program receives approximately 70% of the allocation and the remaining 30% is distributed to the States and Small Cities Program. Maryland's CDBG Program is administered by the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), in cooperation with the Maryland Department of Business and Economic Development (DBED). Funding Levels The State of Maryland receives its share of the 30% allocated to States and Small Cities based on poverty and population statistics. Maryland's Program is divided into two major funding categories: Community Development and Economic Development. Community Development receives approximately 72% of the allocation and Economic Development receives 25%. The remaining funds are spent for State administration of the Program (2% + $100,000) and technical assistance to grantees (1%). USES OF FUNDS CDBG funded projects must meet one of three national objectives: Principally benefits persons of low- and moderate- income Eliminates slum and blight Meets an urgent need of recent origin threatens public health and safety Eligible projects generally fall into three types: Housing Public facilities (water/sewer; streets; childcare, senior or community centers; shelters) Economic development projects Over a designated three-year period, the State must cumulatively use 70% of its allocation to benefit persons of low and moderate income CDBG funded programs must meet one of three national objectives: (1) Principally benefits persons of low- and moderate- income, (2) Eliminates slum and blight, and (3) Meets an urgent need of recent origin threatens public health and safety.

Percent of Structurally Deficient Bridges,1,"The percentage of MDTA structurally deficient (SD) bridges within a given Calendar year.

Inspections are conducted every year on all MDTA facilities. Defects identified in yearly inspections are assigned a defect rating based on severity by the inspector.  As a measure of quality assurance and control, the rating is reviewed and confirmed by in-house inspection staff during review of the inspection reports. The defects are prioritized based on the confirmed rating and major rehabilitation, total replacement or proactive system preservation projects are developed based on the priorities and overall condition assessment.   

Bridges are considered structurally deficient if significant load carrying elements are found to be in a poor (or worse) condition due to deterioration and/or damage, or have a low weight restriction.  The fact that a bridge is structurally deficient does not imply that it is unsafe.  MDTA reported 5 structurally deficient bridges from the 2011 inspection cycle and four of these bridges are already in construction with the fifth in design for full replacement in 2014.  The number of structurally deficient bridges is not anticipated to increase significantly over the next several years as MDTA continues to address needs using a bridge management system to identify and address those bridges that are nearing the end of their useful life.","reported, year, 's, facility, funding, programs"

Hatem Memorial Bridge, I-395 and I-95 in Baltimore City (Fort McHenry Tunnel), I-695 (Francis Scott Key Bridge), Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge, the Bay Bridge (twin structures) and the Intercounty Connector (ICC/MD200). The annual inspection process includes the development of a Structural Inventory and Appraisal (SI&A) assessment that is submitted to the Federal Highway Administration each April for the preceding calendar year.The data for this measure is collected from the SI&A assessment that is performed yearly by the MDTA's facilities inspection consultant. 

 The MDTA continued to be successful in having 100 percent of its bridges fully operational and functioning (no weight restrictions), allowing all emergency vehicles, school buses, vehicles serving the economy of an area, and legally loaded vehicles to safely traverse. Bridges are considered structurally deficient if significant load carrying elements are found to be in a poor (or worse) condition due to deterioration and/or damage, or have a low weight restriction.

Maryland Annual Vehicle Miles of Travel,1,"Annual Vehicle Miles of Travel (AVMT) represents the estimated number of miles driven on Maryland's public highways for a given year. There are two components used to estimate AVMT - traffic count data and highway mileage.
Traffic count data is summarized and reported as Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT).

AADTs are calculated from short-term (48-hour) traffic counts performed on all publicly maintained roads in Maryland (including county and municipal).  These counts are factored to account for seasonal variation in traffic patterns and represent an “Average Day”. 

For planning purposes, AADT's are assigned to highway segments in order to provide a picture of traffic patterns is on the highway system on an average day.
Highway mileage statistics are complied annually based on mileage reports from the local jurisdictions and SHA and MDTA offices.  Any mileage changes  are field verified by SHA's data collections crews.   

AVMT is calculated by multiplying the AADT on a road segment by the segment length. Because AADT represents Daily traffic, the result is multiplied by 365 to represent Annual Vehicle Miles of Travel. (AVMT = AADT X SECTION LENGTH X365)","reported, year, 's, facility, funding, programs"

Community Development Block Grant Awards State FY 13,1,"Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds help strengthen Maryland’s communities by expanding affordable housing opportunities, creating jobs, stabilizing neighborhoods, and improving overall quality of life.  
Congress created the Community Development Block Grant Program under Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The primary objective is to develop viable communities, provide decent housing and a suitable living environment, and to expand economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) oversees the Program. 
The CDBG Program is comprised of two parts. The Entitlement Program is directly administered by HUD and provides Federal funds to large metropolitan ""entitlement"" communities. The States and Small Cities Program provides Federal funds to the States and Puerto Rico (with the exception of Hawaii) who then distribute funds to ""non-entitlement"" counties, small cities and towns. 
Congress allocates funds to the program annually. The Entitlement Program receives approximately 70% of the allocation and the remaining 30% is distributed to the States and Small Cities Program.
Maryland's CDBG Program is administered by the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), in cooperation with the Maryland Department of Business and Economic Development (DBED). 
Funding Levels The State of Maryland receives its share of the 30% allocated to States and Small Cities based on poverty and population statistics. Maryland's Program is divided into two major funding categories: Community Development and Economic Development. Community Development receives approximately 72% of the allocation and Economic Development receives 25%. The remaining funds are spent for State administration of the Program (2% + $100,000) and technical assistance to grantees (1%). USES OF FUNDS CDBG funded projects must meet one of three national objectives: Principally benefits persons of low- and moderate- income Eliminates slum and blight Meets an urgent need of recent origin threatens public health and safety Eligible projects generally fall into three types: Housing Public facilities (water/sewer; streets; childcare, senior or community centers; shelters) Economic development projects Over a designated three-year period, the State must cumulatively use 70% of its allocation to benefit persons of low and moderate income
CDBG funded programs must meet one of three national objectives: (1) Principally benefits persons of low- and moderate- income, (2) Eliminates slum and blight, and (3) Meets an urgent need of recent origin threatens public health and safety.
Eligible projects generally fall into three types: (1) Housing, (2) Public facilities (water/sewer; streets; childcare, senior or community centers; shelters), and (3) Economic development projects.

Scope description  
Attributes
The States and railroads maintain their own file and get updated to the FRA. The information is reported to the FRA on the U.S. DOT-ARR Crossing inventory form.


Attributes
The quality of the inventory can vary because a record of grade crossing location is being maintained by each state and railroad that is responsible for maintaining its respective information.





Lineage  ▼►Lineage statement
The data was downloaded from the HWY-Rail Crossing Inventory Files. All crossings that were closed or abandon were queried out of the data.  All of the crossings with a zero within the latitude or longitude were queried out.  Any crossing outside a bounding box of box ((Latitude >= 18 & Latitude <= 72) AND (Longitude >= -171 & Longitude <= -63)) were queried out.

2013 Maryland HOPE Counseling Network Grant Awards,1,"On February 14, 2013 members of the Maryland HOPE Counseling Network were awarded $11.8 million in grant awards, the highest level of funding for foreclosure prevention counseling in state history. The period covered by these awards is fiscal years 2013-2015. The Network is a group of 39 statewide nonprofit agencies that provide foreclosure prevention assistance. The Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) provides financial support and training to these agencies. These counselors are the critical link in assisting individuals facing foreclosures, acting as a resource to negotiate reasonable terms with mortgage servicers, and advising citizens on the best actions to take to save their homes. The funds, made available through the Office of Attorney General Douglas Gansler and the Maryland Housing Counseling Fund, are part of Maryland’s award from the National Mortgage Loan Servicing Practices Settlement and are being administered by DHCD.","reported, year, 's, facility, funding, programs"

Maryland Statewide Forest Conservation Easements,1,"This dataset is intended to satisfy the new geospatial reporting requirements beginning with the 2010 fiscal year reporting period. The Forest Conservation Act of 1991 requires units of local government with planning and zoning authority to establish and implement local forest conservation programs, and provides for the Department of Natural Resource’s (DNR) administration of forest conservation requirements. During the 2008 Legislative Session, HB972 was adopted which effected the Forest Conservation Act's reporting and enforcement requirements. On or before July 1st of each year, the DNR shall submit to the Senate Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee and the House Environmental Matters Committee a statewide report compiled from local authorities. Included with this report DNR will also be required to submit, to the best practicable extent, the size shape and location of all conserved and planted forest areas submitted in an electronic geographic information system or other similar computer aided design format.","reported, year, 's, facility, funding, programs"
Maryland Environmental Trust Easements,1,"The Maryland Environmental Trust (MET) is a statewide local land trust governed by a citizen Board of Trustees. Since its creation by the General Assembly in 1967, MET's main goal is the preservation of open land, such as farmland, forest land, and significant natural resources. The primary tool for doing this is the conservation easement, a voluntary agreement between a landowner and the MET Board of Trustees. 

MET Conservation Easements promote growth management, the protection of significant natural resources and rural areas, and discourage sprawling development patterns. A Conservation Easement is a perpetual legal agreement between a landowner (grantor) and the Trust (grantee) ensuring that a property shall not be developed beyond a limit agreed upon by both parties. The land is thereby protected and preserved without detriment to the rights of ownership, occupancy, or privacy, while the agreement provides for significant income, estate, and property tax benefits.","reported, year, 's, facility, funding, programs"

NOTE: Adjacent land may also be represented for topological completeness (inholdings) or because of their potential for natural resource protection (owned by federal, other state agency or local govenment) - see ""ownedby"" attribute for details. These files were created for the planning purposes of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. However, not all DNR owned lands have been surveyed and mapped at this time. Therefore, data should not be used as a definitive source of land ownership.","watershed, digital, wetlands, bay, using, 's"

These files were created for planning purposes and should not be used as a definitive source of mapped data for any of the associated types of land ownership. There have been intentional omissions due to sensitive data types and in some cases, the source documents cannot be considered complete.

The Federal Lands data layer was updated to show the most current known lands presently owned by the Federal Government. The sources of the updates came from several sources (the US Park Service, Maryland Department of Planning, MD Property View, ed. 2005, etc.). Ownership status was checked over parcel boundaries and known property records for completeness and accuracy. US Postal properties were not included in this data set.","reported, year, 's, facility, funding, programs"
Maryland Green Infrastructure Hubs and Corridors,11,"Maryland's green infrastructure is a network of undeveloped lands that provide the bulk of the state's natural support system. These data map hub and corridor elements within the green infrastructure. The Green Infrastructure Assessment was developed to provide decision support for Maryland's Department of Natural Resources land conservation programs. Ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving soils, regulating climate, and maintaining hydrologic function, are all provided by the existing expanses of forests, wetlands, and other natural lands. These ecologically valuable lands also provide marketable goods and services, like forest products, fish and wildlife, and recreation. The Green Infrastructure serves as vital habitat for wild species and contributes in many ways to the health and quality of life for Maryland residents. To identify and prioritize Maryland's green infrastructure, we developed a tool called the Green Infrastructure Assessment (GIA). The GIA was based on principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology, and provides a consistent approach to evaluating land conservation and restoration efforts in Maryland. It specifically attempts to recognize: a variety of natural resource values (as opposed to a single species of wildlife, for example), how a given place fits into a larger system, the ecological importance of natural open space in rural and developed areas, the importance of coordinating local, state and even interstate planning, and the need for a regional or landscape-level view for wildlife conservation. The GIA identified two types of important resource lands - ""hubs"" and ""corridors."" 

Hubs typically large contiguous areas, separated by major roads and/or human land uses, that contain one or more of the following: Large blocks of contiguous interior forest (containing at least 250 acres, plus a transition zone of 300 feet) Large wetland complexes, with at least 250 acres of unmodified wetlands; Important animal and plant habitats of at least 100 acres, including rare, threatened, and endangered species locations, unique ecological communities, and migratory bird habitats; relatively pristine stream and river segments (which, when considered with adjacent forests and wetlands, are at least 100 acres) that support trout, mussels, and other sensitive aquatic organisms; and existing protected natural resource lands which contain one or more of the above (for example, state parks and forests, National Wildlife Refuges, locally owned reservoir properties, major stream valley parks, and Nature Conservancy preserves). In the GIA model, the above features were identified from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial data that covered the entire state. Developed areas and major roads were excluded, areas less than 100 contiguous acres were dropped, adjacent forest and wetland were added to the remaining hubs, and the edges were smoothed. The average size of all hubs in the state is approximately 2200 acres.


Corridors are linear features connecting hubs together to help animals and plant propagules to move between hubs. Corridors were identified using many sets of data, including land cover, roads, streams, slope, flood plains, aquatic resource data, and fish blockages. Generally speaking, corridors connect hubs of similar type (hubs containing forests are connected to one another; while those consisting primarily of wetlands are connected to others containing wetlands). Corridors generally follow the best ecological or ""most natural"" routes between hubs. Typically these are streams with wide riparian buffers and healthy fish communities. Other good wildlife corridors include ridge lines or forested valleys. Developed areas, major roads, and other unsuitable features were avoided.","watershed, digital, wetlands, bay, using, 's"

Maryland's 8 Digit Sub-Watersheds,11,"This is statewide digital watershed data. This file depicts the State with 138 separate watersheds each with an 8-digit numeric code. This file was created primarily for State and Federal agency use.  The creation of this file goes back many years and involved several State and Federal agencies. This file was derived from a more detailed watershed file (Maryland's Third-Order Watershed).  The U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) redefined the third order watersheds creating the HUA14 file. The process used to create this file is consistent with the elevation contour information found on the US Geological Survey's 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps and the Maryland Department of the Environment's watershed location and naming conventions.  This file is similar, but not identical, to the US Natural Resources Conservation Service's (NRCS) Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC11) watershed file. The watersheds define Strahler (Strahler 1952 p.1120) third order stream drainage by contours on U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets.  Some watershed drainage areas were defined for streams less than third order and some large area Watersheds were split to maintain a maximum size of 15,000 acres. This watershed data is used by many state and local government agencies to accurately locate and report many landscape activities by watershed in Maryland.","watershed, digital, wetlands, bay, using, 's"
Maryland's Third Order (12 Digit) Watersheds,11,"This is statewide digital watershed data. It was created primarily for state and federal agency use.

Some watershed drainage areas were defined for streams less than third order and some large area watershed were split to maintain a maximum size of 15,000 acres. The watershed boundaries in this file were developed in a joint state and federal effort to create a consistent watershed file for use by all government agencies with an interest in Maryland's watersheds. The U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) redefined the third order watersheds creating the HUA14 file. This file contains all of the HUA14 watersheds and some added watersheds to maintain water quality sampling sites. It was also used to create the Maryland Sub-Watershed file.","watershed, digital, wetlands, bay, using, 's"

Surface Water Quality Assessments,1,"The Integrated Report (IR) combines two water quality reports required under sections 305(b) and 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act.  Section 305(b) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to perform annual water quality assessments to determine the status of jurisdictional waters.  Section 303(d) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to identify waters assessed as not meeting water quality standards(see Code of Maryland Regulations 26.08.02).  Waters that do not meet standards may require a Total Maximum Daily Load to determine the maximum amount of an impairing substance or pollutant that a particular water body can assimilate and still meet water quality criteria.  Historically, the 303(d) List and the 305(b) report were submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as separate documents but more recent guidance has called for combining these two reports into a single biennial publication.
