CDP is \"Census Designated Place\" - a recognized community that was unincorporated at the time of the 2000 Census.\r\n\r\n1) Data may not add due to rounding.  All unemployment rates shown are calculated on unrounded data.\r\n2) These data are not seasonally adjusted.\r\n\r\nMethodology: Monthly city and CDP labor force data are derived by multiplying current estimates of county employment and unemployment by the employment and unemployment shares (ratios) of each city and CDP at the time of the 2000 Census.  Ratios for cities of 25,000 or more persons were developed from special tabulations based on household population only from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  For smaller cities and CDP, ratios were calculated from published census data.\r\n\r\nCity and CDP unrounded employment and unemployment are summed to get the labor force. The unemployment rate is calculated by dividing unemployment by the labor force.  Then the labor force, employment, and unemployment are rounded.\r\n\r\nThis method assumes that the rates of change in employment and unemployment, since 2000, are exactly the same in each city and CDP as at the county level (i.e., that the shares are still accurate).  If this assumption is not true for a specific city or CDP, then the estimates for that area may not represent the current economic conditions. Since this assumption is untested, caution should be employed when using these data.","title":"Employment Data by City","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.smcgov.org/api/views/dfpx-psxi/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.smcgov.org/api/views/dfpx-psxi/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.smcgov.org/api/views/dfpx-psxi/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.smcgov.org/api/views/dfpx-psxi/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Business"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.smcgov.org/d/kyvh-gixz","issued":"2015-10-22","modified":"2015-10-25","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["demo press release"],"identifier":"https://data.smcgov.org/api/views/kyvh-gixz","publisher":{"name":"data.smcgov.org"},"description":"County of San Mateo Demo Press Releases.\r\nThis dataset is for a Socrata API / PHP talk I am giving at SMC Civic Tech.\r\nThe PHP code will query the dataset for its press releases and display them as two articles in a single web page.","title":"Demo_Press_Releases","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.smcgov.org/api/views/kyvh-gixz/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.smcgov.org/api/views/kyvh-gixz/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.smcgov.org/api/views/kyvh-gixz/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.smcgov.org/api/views/kyvh-gixz/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"license":"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/"},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.smcgov.org/d/up4k-6c77","issued":"2015-10-22","modified":"2015-10-22","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["census","unincorporated","demographics"],"identifier":"https://data.smcgov.org/api/views/up4k-6c77","publisher":{"name":"data.smcgov.org"},"description":"Demographics, including median income, total population, race, ethnicity, and age for unincorporated areas in San Mateo County.

These funds were derived from a one-time distribution of Housing Trust Funds held by former redevelopment agencies in San Mateo County. These unrestricted general funds - which initiated the County's Affordable Housing Fund (AHF) - were set aside to provide financial assistance for the development of multifamily affordable rental housing and provision of emergency and transitional shelter in the County. The Board directed the County's Department of Housing to develop allocation guidelines and recommend projects for funding.  As of May 2014, approximately $13.2 million of AHF funds have been allocated, collectively, to six multifamily affordable rental housing developments and four emergency and transitional housing projects (\"AHF 1.0\").\n\nOn August 5, 2014, the County Board of Supervisors authorized the Housing Authority of the County of San Mateo to publish another NOFA, using funds from the Housing Authority's Housing Assistance Program (HAP) Reserves to create affordable housing options for low-, very low-, and extremely low-income households. A total of $5 million was awarded to five projects, including three multifamily affordable housing rental developments, a homeownership project, and a farmworker housing program.

Areas of exclusion include National Parks, Military Bases, and with notification restrictions within a 5 mile area of airports. This map shows areas where drones cannot be flown (over the Golden Gate National Recreation Area) as well as areas where UAS operators must notify an airport or control tower when flying within 5 nautical miles of an airport. The following are the most important regulations related to UAS operations: 1. Fly no higher than 400 feet and remain below any surrounding obstacles when possible. 2. Do not intentionally fly over unprotected persons or moving vehicles, and remain at least 25 feet away from individuals and vulnerable property. 3. Check and follow all local laws and ordinances before flying over private property. 4. Remain well clear of and do not interfere with manned aircraft operations, and you must see and avoid other aircraft and obstacles at all times. 5. Contact the airport or control tower before flying within five miles of an airport.
