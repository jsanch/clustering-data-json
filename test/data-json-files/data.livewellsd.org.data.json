In addition, the maps show the locations of certified farm markets, farm stands, community-supported agriculture farms (CSAs) and community gardens. Not\r\nall retail food vendors are shown (caterers, spice/herb suppliers, and vitamin/nutrition stores were not mapped). Retailers were broadly grouped and symbolized (green to red) based on the likelihood that someone would be able to readily find fruits/vegetables and other nutritious foods. For example, convenience stores tend to offer fewer nutritious foods (red symbol) compared to farm markets (green symbol).
