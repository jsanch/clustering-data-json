Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation (STATE) System.  YRBSS Data. The YRBS is conducted biennially and collects data on a variety of youth risk behaviors including tobacco use. The YRBS uses a two-stage cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in high schools (grades 9-12).  The YRBS uses SUDAAN to calculate asymmetric confidence intervals based on the logit transformation. The logit transformation constrains confidence interval limits to vary between a lower limit of 0% and an upper limit of 100%.   The data for the STATE System were extracted from YRBSS surveys from participating states.  Tobacco topics included are cigarette smoking prevalence, cigarette smoking frequency, and smokeless tobacco products prevalence.","title":"Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System (YRBSS) Data","programCode":["009:029"],"distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/3596-ayf6/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/3596-ayf6/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/3596-ayf6/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/3596-ayf6/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Survey Data"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/d/fpp2-pp25","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2015-11-17","modified":"2015-11-17","keyword":["osh","office on smoking and health","state system","tobacco","survey","behavioral","risk","surveillance","tobacco use","cigarette","cigarette use","adult","smoking","smoking status","smoker","current","former","never","ever","frequency","every day","some days","demographics","age","gender","race","ethnicity","education","cessation","quit","prevalence"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"name":"chronicdata.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/fpp2-pp25","description":"1996-2010.

GHPSS follows an anonymous, self-administered format for data collection. GHPSS uses a core questionnaire on demographics, prevalence of cigarette smoking and other tobacco use, knowledge and attitudes about tobacco use, exposure to secondhand smoke, desire for smoking cessation, and training received regarding patient counseling on smoking cessation techniques. Questionnaires are translated into local languages as needed.
