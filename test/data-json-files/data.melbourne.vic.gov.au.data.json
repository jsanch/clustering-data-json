The dataset demonstrates Melbourne's Liveability using objective data. It is also available in summarised form on the WCCD's open data portal.\r\n\r\nIndicators include: Fire and emergency response; Governance; Health; Recreation; Safety; Shelter; Solid Waste; Telecommunications and Innovation; Transportation; Urban Planning; Wastewater; Water and Sanitation; Economy; Education; Energy; Environment; and Finance.\r\n\r\nThis data can best be used to benchmark Melbourne's liveability compared to other cities around the world. Governments can use the data to promote the advantages of Melbourne globally (such as ‘liveability’ or economic/investment potential); inform and engage ‘communities of interest’ in decision making; inform decisions through data analysis; input to discussions of targets through benchmarking; evaluate impacts of government interventions and infrastructure projects on the performance of the city; and establish a basis for information sharing about what works between Melbourne and other cities.\r\n\r\nIn 2015 City of Melbourne is again reporting, to WCCD, indicators for Melbourne Local Government Area. In addition, statistics for Greater Melbourne will be reported and both data sets will be published on the open data portal.\r\n\r\nAll indicators in this table conform with the new international standard (ISO) for city indicators - ISO37120 which is managed by WCCD.
