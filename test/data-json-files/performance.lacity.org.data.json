The California Economic Development Department EDD currently releases employment data for the city level, but these data are estimated based on Bureau of Labor Statistics at the county level with a fixed ratio between city and county according to the 2000 Census. (That is, EDD assumes that ratios of household employment and unemployment from City to County are unchanged since 2000.) \n\nTo estimate payroll employment for the City, UCLA Anderson Forecast examines the dynamic relationship of BLS Current Employment Statistics and Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages data over time between City and County and adopts an appropriate weighted moving average method to reduce the measurement error. To estimate household employment and labor force of the City, UCLA Anderson Forecast examines and uses the dynamic relationship from BLS's Current Population Survey and American Community Survey data over time between the City and County.","title":"UCLA Anderson Forecast - Los Angeles City Monthly Employment Estimate Non-Seasonally Adjusted","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://performance.lacity.org/api/views/ksyv-cia6/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://performance.lacity.org/api/views/ksyv-cia6/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://performance.lacity.org/api/views/ksyv-cia6/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://performance.lacity.org/api/views/ksyv-cia6/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://performance.lacity.org/d/u7vv-5qst","issued":"2015-09-29","modified":"2015-09-29","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["311","myla311","311 app"],"identifier":"https://performance.lacity.org/api/views/u7vv-5qst","publisher":{"name":"performance.lacity.org"},"description":"This data shows the source of 311 requests and the wait time to speak to an agent when dialing 311.","title":"311 Data","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://performance.lacity.org/api/views/u7vv-5qst/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://performance.lacity.org/api/views/u7vv-5qst/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://performance.lacity.org/api/views/u7vv-5qst/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://performance.lacity.org/api/views/u7vv-5qst/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Government"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://performance.lacity.org/d/gtr2-bfku","issued":"2015-09-29","modified":"2015-09-29","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["fire response time","fire calls","fire call processing time"],"identifier":"https://performance.lacity.org/api/views/gtr2-bfku","publisher":{"name":"performance.lacity.org"},"description":"FireStatLA City-wide Response Metrics","title":"FireStatLA City-wide Response Metrics","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://performance.lacity.org/api/views/gtr2-bfku/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://performance.lacity.org/api/views/gtr2-bfku/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://performance.lacity.org/api/views/gtr2-bfku/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://performance.lacity.org/api/views/gtr2-bfku/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Government"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://performance.lacity.org/d/w7j9-edxy","issued":"2015-08-25","modified":"2015-08-25","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["port","harbor","teu","container","shipping","freight","cargo"],"identifier":"https://performance.lacity.org/api/views/w7j9-edxy","publisher":{"name":"performance.lacity.org"},"description":"Monthly and cumulative calendar year to date (CYTD) figures for total TEU counts.
