The data table shows the percentage of stores with tobacco advertisements near candy and those with tobacco advertisements below three feet in 2008 and 2011, broken down by store type. Tobacco advertisements placed below three feet are easier for children to see, and advertisements near candy are in a location that is likely to draw a child's attention. The sampling excluded stores that required either club membership (e.g., Costco or golf courses) or had minimum-age restrictions (e.g., bars). Also excluded were stores that were unusual store categories that were unlikely to display or advertise tobacco products, such as donut shops. The baseline sample (CTAS 2008) is historical. The original sample was derived from a 1997 list of 40,186 cigarette retailers, as enumerated by the California Board of Equalization (BOE). The sample stores and addresses were matched to the 2011 retailer licensing list, which was supplied by the BOE to the California Tobacco Control Program. Of the 545 stores with valid data in 2008, 442 (81.1 percent) were verified by phone as still selling cigarettes. A randomly selected list of stores from the 2011 licensing list was also phone verified. This list was used to replace all 2008 stores that were no longer in business or no longer sold cigarettes.

The HO CDI SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of CDI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital in 2013 to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent CDI rate data.  CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO CDI incidence include the type of CDI test used by the hospital, if the hospital is affiliated with a medical school, hospital bed size, and the burden of community-onset CDI in patients admitted to the hospital.  Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals’ infections. For more precise comparisons, NHSN only calculates a SIR when at least one HO CDI is predicted, which is determined by patient volume and other factors predictive of acquiring CDI. However, we calculated the SIR for such hospitals with HO CDI predicted less than one if the number of HO CDI observed was greater than zero.  For each hospital with a CDI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number.  Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital’s CDI SIR as: \r\n• No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, \r\n• Higher - high or more infections than predicted, or \r\n• Lower - low or fewer infections than predicted.\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf.

Another explanation is that unemployment causes the loss of latent functions (social contact, social status, time structure and personal identity) which can result in stigma, isolation and loss of self-worth.

The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/Pages/HealthyCommunityIndicators.aspx). Political participation can be associated with the health of a community through two possible mechanisms: through the implementation of social policies or as an indirect measure of social capital.  Disparities in political participation across socioeconomic groups can influence political outcomes and the resulting policies could have an impact on the opportunities available to the poor to live a healthy life.  Although there is no direct evidentiary connection between voter registration or participation and health, there is evidence that populations with higher levels of political participation also have greater social capital, the existence of trust and mutual aid among the members of a society.

The CLABSI data for each hospital patient care location include number of CLABSIs, central line-days and patient days, CLABSI rates per 1000 line days and their 95% confidence intervals. We also performed a statistical analysis to determine if the rates are statistically higher, lower, or no different than California average rates. California average rates for 2013 can be found at http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/hai/Documents/2013-CLABSI-T1.pdf. CLABSI rates are affected by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance practices, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While stratifying CLABSI rates by patient care location makes rates more comparable, it cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI rates. A low CLABSI rate may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may reflect less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including failure to appropriately apply standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high rate may reflect failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or more aggressive infection surveillance including more consistent application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols.

Commute trips to work represent 19% of travel miles in the United States. The predominant mode – the automobile - offers extraordinary personal mobility and independence, but it is also associated with health hazards, such as air pollution, motor vehicle crashes, pedestrian injuries and fatalities, and sedentary lifestyles. Automobile commuting has been linked to stress-related health problems. Active modes of transport – bicycling and walking alone and in combination with public transit – offer opportunities for physical activity, which is associated with lowering rates of heart disease and stroke, diabetes, colon and breast cancer, dementia and depression. Risk of injury and death in collisions are higher in urban areas with more concentrated vehicle and pedestrian activity.

While CLABSI SIRs are adjusted for patient care locations, they cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI SIRs. A low CLABSI SIR may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may reflect less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including failure to appropriately apply standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high SIR may reflect failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or more aggressive infection surveillance including more consistent application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols.

The number of predicted infections is calculated using SSI probabilities estimated from multivariate logistic regression models constructed from NHSN data during a baseline time period 2006 through 2008, which represents a reference population’s SSI experience. To enforce a minimum precision criterion, an SIR is calculated only if the number of observed infections is at least one. SIRs are based on the date of procedure, not the date of the SSI event.

The HO MRSA BSI SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of MRSA BSI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital in 2013 to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent MRSA BSI rate data.  MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when the first positive blood test is obtained after the third day of hospitalization. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO MRSA BSI incidence include hospital bed size, affiliation with a medical school, and the community burden of MRSA BSI as observed in patients admitted to the hospital. Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals’ infections. For more precise comparisons, NHSN only calculates a SIR when at least one HO MRSA BSI is predicted, which is determined by patient volume and other factors predictive of acquiring MRSA BSI. However, we calculated the SIR for such hospitals with HO MRSA BSI predicted less than one if the number of HO MRSA BSI observed was greater than zero. For each hospital with a MRSA BSI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number. Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital’s MRSA BSI SIR as: \r\n• No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, \r\n• Higher - high or more infections than predicted, or \r\n• Lower - low or fewer infections than predicted.\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf","title":"Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Bloodstream Infections In Hospitals, 2013","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/x6ev-sgxq/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/x6ev-sgxq/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/x6ev-sgxq/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/x6ev-sgxq/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Diseases and Conditions"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://cdph.data.ca.gov/d/x39i-9t72","issued":"2014-12-18","modified":"2015-10-29","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:HAIprogram@cdph.ca.gov"},"keyword":["hai","bacterial","clostridium difficile","cross infection","epidemiology","healthcare","hospitals","long-term care","nosocomial infections","surveillance"],"identifier":"https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/x39i-9t72","publisher":{"name":"cdph.data.ca.gov"},"description":"Long-term acute care is a hospital defined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as a licensed general acute care hospital providing care for patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay for all patients of greater than 25 days.
