analysis of the opportunities residents are afforded in “racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty,” also called RCAPs or ECAPs. An RCAP or ECAP is a neighborhood with significant concentrations of extreme poverty and minority populations.\r\nHUD’s definition of an RCAP/ECAP is:\r\n•\tA Census tract that has a non‐white population of 50 percent or more AND a poverty rate of 40 percent or more; OR\r\n•\tA Census tract that has a non‐white population of 50 percent or more AND the poverty rate is three times the average tract poverty rate for the metro/micro area, whichever is lower.\r\n\r\nWhy the 40 percent threshold? The RCAP/ECAP definition is not meant to suggest that a slightly‐lower‐than‐40 percent poverty rate is ideal or acceptable. The threshold was borne out of research that concluded a 40 percent poverty rate was the point at which a neighborhood became significantly socially and economically challenged. Conversely, research has shown that areas with up to 14 percent of poverty have no noticeable effect on community opportunity.

reviewed annually. Generally, changes to the fuel rate are effective on Jan. 1 for the calendar year. Effective FY 2013, the power supply adjustment is set as part of the annual budget process. Fuel Charge rates are established based on the type of electric service required by a customer and fall into one of three levels: secondary, primary or transmission.\n\nPrimary Level Customers - This rate is applicable to electric service required by any customer who receives service at 12,500 volts (nominal) to 69,000 volts and whose demand for power does not meet or exceed 3,000 kilowatts at any interval during the most recent June through September billing months as determined by the City of Austin. \n\nSecondary Level Customers - This rate is applicable to electric service required by residential customers in single-family dwellings, mobile homes, townhouses, or individually metered apartment units. It is also applicable to any business that does not receive power at a primary or transmission level. Currently, some 30,000 businesses receive the secondary Fuel Charge rate.\n\nTransmission Level Customers - This rate is applicable to electric service required by any customer who receives service at 69,000 volts (nominal) or higher. This rate shall be applied for a minimum of one year. \n\nPrimary and transmission voltage level customers (about 90 industrial customers) essentially receive power directly from a substation. This results in reduced line losses between the point of generation and delivery to the customer. These customers also install and maintain their own equipment at their site needed to step down the voltage before the power enters their facility. As a result, primary and transmission customers pay a slightly lower Fuel Charge.","title":"Power Supply Adjustment/Fuel Charge","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.austintexas.gov/api/views/e7fj-wxvd/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.austintexas.gov/api/views/e7fj-wxvd/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.austintexas.gov/api/views/e7fj-wxvd/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.austintexas.gov/api/views/e7fj-wxvd/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Utility"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.austintexas.gov/d/k5hp-eece","issued":"2015-08-19","modified":"2015-11-09","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["\"electric vehicles\"","ev","\"charging network\"","\"austin energy\""],"identifier":"https://data.austintexas.gov/api/views/k5hp-eece","publisher":{"name":"data.austintexas.gov"},"description":"Austin Energy operates the Plug-In EVerywhere™ network of plug-in electric vehicle charging stations located at sites throughout the service territory.

Previous studies were made in 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2003. The 2010 study area included all of Travis County and parts of Hays, Williamson, Bastrop and Blanco Counties. Land use parcel geometry was based on the City of Austin's 2003 Land Use Study and City of Austin base map or county appraisal district GIS and CAD files. Historical land use data from previous studies, especially 2003, county tax appraisal district information, aerial photographs or other land-use related information was used to characterize the 2010 land uses. City of Austin staff, local planning or engineering consultants, researchers, students or area residents can use land use data for water resource research, planning, management, infrastructure and transportation planning, development, comprehensive or neighborhood planning and spatial analysis. Specifically the 2010 land use layer can be used to study land use change and development patterns and as an input to water quality, flood, erosion or transportation models. The following includes some, but not all data limitations: \"Land use is current as of approximately September, 2010\", \"Parcels along the study area boundary may represent only a portion of the original\", \"Parcels adjacent to area lakes differ from those in the 2003 Land Use Study,\" \"Land use polygons may differ from tax appraisal district parcels\", \"Corrections to the original 2010 Land Use Study will be shown in periodic updates\", and \"Methods used to characterize land use in the latest study differ from previous studies and may not be directly comparable.\" This product has been produced by the Communications and Technology Department for the sole purpose of geographic reference.

See http://www.austintexas.gov/department/planning for more information. The Growth Concept Map assembles compact and walkable activity centers and corridors, as well as job centers, and coordinates them with future transportation improvements. These centers and corridors allow people to reside, work, shop, access services, people watch, recreate, and hang out without traveling far distances. Within them, the design and scale of buildings and the design and availability of parks and gathering spaces will welcome people of all ages and abilities. They will be walkable, bikable, and connected to one another, the rest of the city, and the region by roads, transit, bicycle routes and lanes, and trails. The activity centers and corridors included on this map identify locations for additional people and jobs above what currently exists on the ground. Unlike more detailed small-area plan maps, the Growth Concept Map provides broad direction for future growth and is not parcel specific. Centers that are already established by existing small-area plans, such as those for East Riverside Drive or Highland Mall, are drawn to reflect those plans. Centers without small-area plans are simply shown with a circle, indicating scale and general location.

See http://www.austintexas.gov/department/planning for more information. The Growth Concept Map assembles compact and walkable activity centers and corridors, as well as job centers, and coordinates them with future transportation improvements. These centers and corridors allow people to reside, work, shop, access services, people watch, recreate, and hang out without traveling far distances. Within them, the design and scale of buildings and the design and availability of parks and gathering spaces will welcome people of all ages and abilities. They will be walkable, bikable, and connected to one another, the rest of the city, and the region by roads, transit, bicycle routes and lanes, and trails. The activity centers and corridors included on this map identify locations for additional people and jobs above what currently exists on the ground. Unlike more detailed small-area plan maps, the Growth Concept Map provides broad direction for future growth and is not parcel specific. Centers that are already established by existing small-area plans, such as those for East Riverside Drive or Highland Mall, are drawn to reflect those plans. Centers without small-area plans are simply shown with a circle, indicating scale and general location. Specifying boundaries for these centers may occur through small-area plans or general guidelines for implementing this plan.

Part of that success is due to a Western Union wire program set up by Austin Energy to transfer customer payments to the utility. Utility bill payments can be made via Western Union at some 50 retail locations.","title":"Utility Payment Methods","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.austintexas.gov/api/views/cusd-m48y/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.austintexas.gov/api/views/cusd-m48y/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.austintexas.gov/api/views/cusd-m48y/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.austintexas.gov/api/views/cusd-m48y/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Financial"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.austintexas.gov/d/wr7f-jdtu","issued":"2011-12-16","modified":"2015-08-25","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"identifier":"https://data.austintexas.gov/api/views/wr7f-jdtu","publisher":{"name":"data.austintexas.gov"},"description":"Austin Energy’s GreenChoice program is the nation’s most successful utility-sponsored, voluntary green-pricing energy program.
