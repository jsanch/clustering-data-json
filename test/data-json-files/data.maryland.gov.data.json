The Inspection Contractors qualify to perform different types of inspections based on the accreditation category(ies) of the inspector(s) that work for the contractor. There are three kinds of lead paint inspectors. They qualify in the following ways:\r\nVisual Inspector (VI) - May perform Full or Modified Risk Reduction Inspections. This is done by a Dust Inspection or a Visual Inspection after unit has been prepared for inspection by an accredited lead paint abatement contractor. Visual Inspectors may also perform testing for Clearance.\r\nInspector Technician (IT) - May perform Lead Free Inspections. This is done by X-ray testing or paint chip analysis of all surfaces. Inspector Technicians may also perform testing for Clearance.\r\nRisk Assessor (RA) - May perform all the functions of a VI and IT. Risk Assessors may also perform Lead Hazard Screenings and Risk Assessments. Risk Assessors may identify lead hazards and make recommendations from analysis of X-ray testing, paint chips, dust, soil, water and questionnaires. Risk Assessors may also perform testing for Clearance.\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nFor your convenience MDE publishes this list of accredited lead contractors that meet Maryland’s standards to perform abatement activities involving lead-based paint. The list is an information resource only. MDE does not endorse any of the contractors included on this list nor does MDE provide any warranty about their performance.

When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.

The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital Flood Insurance Study (FIS) database that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS. This map service is a composite of Effective and Preliminary floodplain data. Q3 data is used where neither Effective or Preliminary data is available for a given community.\r\nThe primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual- chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000.\r\n\r\nFor more information on the Maryland Floodplain visit MDE's website at http://www.mdfloodmaps.net/.

The number of broadband providers per census block is illustrated. Area of broadband availability refers to those individual US Census Blocks, less than 2 square miles, where each facilities-based provider of broadband service can provide broadband services of minimal characteristics within 7 - 10 business days. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is the provision, on either a commercial or non-commercial basis, of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose, an 'end user' of broadband service is a residential or business party, institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not 'end users' for this purpose. An entity is a 'facilities based' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs), special access lines, or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is 'available' at an address if the provider does, or could, within a typical service interval (7 to 10 business days) without an extraordinary commitment of resources, provision two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end-users at that address.

To date, the MIHP is comprised of nearly 90,000 resources, composed of archaeological sites, building, structures, objects and survey districts. A Maryland Inventory form provides a description of historic resource and discusses its history, but the MIHP is not a regulatory instrument, and the determination of a resource’s historic significance is not a requirement for inclusion. Maryland State law provides elsewhere for mechanisms – separate from the MIHP – giving both the State and local jurisdictions the authority to regulate appropriately designated historic resources. The Maryland Inventory should not be confused with the National Register of Historic Places, the Maryland Register of Historic Properties, or local lists of locally designated historic resources, although resources listed in all of the above categories are included in the Maryland Inventory.\r\nFor more information see http://mht.maryland.gov/preserveMaryland.html.

Those preservation easements with the State of Maryland are managed by the State Historic Preservation Office (The Maryland Historical Trust). Generally, the owners of the easement property agree to relinquish partial development rights, to maintain the property, to provide limited public access, and to obtain prior approval for any changes or alterations.  In exchange, The Maryland Historical Trust promises to protect the property by ensuring continuous compliance with the terms of the Easement.  The Trust is also available to advise owners on the correct and best methods of preserving and using their properties. For more information, visit http://mht.maryland.gov/easement.html.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov \r\nThe TIGER/Line Files include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities). An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always nest within a State, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the State in which they are located. The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with State, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing and population. The boundaries of all 2010 Census incorporated places are as of January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The boundaries of all 2010 Census CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).\r\nAfter each decennial census, the Census Bureau delineates urban areas that represent densely developed territory, encompassing residential, commercial, and other nonresidential urban land uses. In general, this territory consists of areas of high population density and urban land use resulting in a representation of the \"urban footprint.\" There are two types of urban areas: urbanized areas (UAs) that contain 50,000 or more people and urban clusters (UCs) that contain at least 2,500 people, but fewer than 50,000 people (except in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam which each contain urban clusters with populations greater than 50,000). Each urban area is identified by a 5-character numeric census code that may contain leading zeroes.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov \r\nThe TIGER/Line Files include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities). An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always nest within a State, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the State in which they are located. The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with State, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing and population. The boundaries of all 2010 Census incorporated places are as of January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The boundaries of all 2010 Census CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).\r\nAfter each decennial census, the Census Bureau delineates urban areas that represent densely developed territory, encompassing residential, commercial, and other nonresidential urban land uses. In general, this territory consists of areas of high population density and urban land use resulting in a representation of the \"urban footprint.\" There are two types of urban areas: urbanized areas (UAs) that contain 50,000 or more people and urban clusters (UCs) that contain at least 2,500 people, but fewer than 50,000 people (except in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam which each contain urban clusters with populations greater than 50,000). Each urban area is identified by a 5-character numeric census code that may contain leading zeroes.

Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas. Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census.\r\nBlock Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. Census 2010 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). \r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.

Area of broadband availability refers to those individual US Census Blocks, less than 2 square miles, where each facilities-based provider of broadband service can provide broadband services of minimal characteristics within 7 - 10 business days. For each area (e.g. census block less than 2 square miles) the provider name and technology they provide there are represented. In addition, advertised and typical upload and download speeds are often reported at these levels. If a provider offers availability to any location within a census block less than 2 square miles, the entire block is deemed available under this effort. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is the provision, on either a commercial or non-commercial basis, of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose, an 'end user' of broadband service is a residential or business party, institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not 'end users' for this purpose. An entity is a 'facilities based' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs), special access lines, or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is 'available' at an address if the provider does, or could, within a typical service interval (7 to 10 business days) without an extraordinary commitment of resources, provision two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end-users at that address.

Area of broadband availability refers to those individual US Census Blocks, less than 2 square miles, where each facilities-based provider of broadband service can provide broadband services of minimal characteristics within 7 - 10 business days. For each area (e.g. census block less than 2 square miles) the provider name and technology they provide there are represented. In addition, advertised and typical upload and download speeds are often reported at these levels. If a provider offers availability to any location within a census block less than 2 square miles, the entire block is deemed available under this effort. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is the provision, on either a commercial or non-commercial basis, of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose, an 'end user' of broadband service is a residential or business party, institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not 'end users' for this purpose. An entity is a 'facilities based' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs), special access lines, or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is 'available' at an address if the provider does, or could, within a typical service interval (7 to 10 business days) without an extraordinary commitment of resources, provision two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end-users at that address.

Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas. Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census.\r\nBlock Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. Census 2010 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). \r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of non-contiguous areas.

Area of broadband availability refers to those individual US Census Blocks, less than 2 square miles, where each facilities-based provider of broadband service can provide broadband services of minimal characteristics within 7 - 10 business days. For each area (e.g. census block less than 2 square miles) the provider name and technology they provide there are represented. In addition, advertised and typical upload and download speeds are often reported at these levels. If a provider offers availability to any location within a census block less than 2 square miles, the entire block is deemed available under this effort. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is the provision, on either a commercial or non-commercial basis, of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose, an 'end user' of broadband service is a residential or business party, institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not 'end users' for this purpose. An entity is a 'facilities based' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs), special access lines, or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is 'available' at an address if the provider does, or could, within a typical service interval (7 to 10 business days) without an extraordinary commitment of resources, provision two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end-users at that address.

Area of broadband availability refers to those individual US Census Blocks, less than 2 square miles, where each facilities-based provider of broadband service can provide broadband services of minimal characteristics within 7 - 10 business days. For each area (e.g. census block less than 2 square miles) the provider name and technology they provide there are represented. In addition, advertised and typical upload and download speeds are often reported at these levels. If a provider offers availability to any location within a census block less than 2 square miles, the entire block is deemed available under this effort. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is the provision, on either a commercial or non-commercial basis, of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose, an 'end user' of broadband service is a residential or business party, institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not 'end users' for this purpose. An entity is a 'facilities based' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs), special access lines, or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is 'available' at an address if the provider does, or could, within a typical service interval (7 to 10 business days) without an extraordinary commitment of resources, provision two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end-users at that address.

Area of broadband availability refers to those individual US Census Blocks, less than 2 square miles, where each facilities-based provider of broadband service can provide broadband services of minimal characteristics within 7 - 10 business days. For each area (e.g. census block less than 2 square miles) the provider name and technology they provide there are represented. In addition, advertised and typical upload and download speeds are often reported at these levels. If a provider offers availability to any location within a census block less than 2 square miles, the entire block is deemed available under this effort. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is the provision, on either a commercial or non-commercial basis, of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose, an 'end user' of broadband service is a residential or business party, institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not 'end users' for this purpose. An entity is a 'facilities based' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs), special access lines, or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is 'available' at an address if the provider does, or could, within a typical service interval (7 to 10 business days) without an extraordinary commitment of resources, provision two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end-users at that address.

These three sectors account for over 85 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Maryland.","title":"Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimates","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/8cmy-9rim/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/8cmy-9rim/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/8cmy-9rim/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/8cmy-9rim/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Energy and Environment"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.maryland.gov/d/sw28-ginq","issued":"2015-09-09","modified":"2015-09-09","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:josh.exler@maryland.gov"},"keyword":["gohs","homeland security","governor's office of homeland security","public safety"],"identifier":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/sw28-ginq","publisher":{"name":"data.maryland.gov"},"description":"This data set shows four sources of grant funding for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security (GOHS) and respective awards from 2003 to present.","title":"Homeland Security Grant Awards","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/sw28-ginq/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/sw28-ginq/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/sw28-ginq/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/sw28-ginq/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Public Safety"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.maryland.gov/d/79zg-5xwz","issued":"2015-09-09","modified":"2015-09-09","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:josh.exler@maryland.gov"},"keyword":["energy","renewable","wind","solar"],"identifier":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/79zg-5xwz","publisher":{"name":"data.maryland.gov"},"description":"This data set describes the amount of energy generated annually by renewable sources in Maryland in megawatt hours (MWh).

In order to make this assessment, MTA staff gathered data on characteristics that are likely to influence TOD potential. The station-specific data is organized into 6 different categories referring to transit activity; station facilities; parking provision and utilization; bicycle and pedestrian access; and local zoning and land availability around each station. \r\n\r\nAs a publicly shared resource, this dataset can be used by local communities to identify and prioritize area improvements in coordination with the MTA that can help attract investment around rail stations.\r\n\r\nYou can view an interactive version of this dataset at geodata.md.gov/tod.\r\n\r\n ** Ridership is calculated the following ways:\r\nMetro Rail ridership is based on Metro gate exit counts.\r\nLight Rail ridership is estimated using a statistical sampling process in line with FTA established guidelines, and approved by the FTA.\r\nMARC ridership is calculated using two (2) independent methods:\r\nMonthly Line level ridership is estimated using a statistical sampling process in line with FTA established guidelines, and approved by the FTA. This method of ridership calculation is used by the MTA for official reporting purposes to State level and Federal level reporting.\r\nStation level ridership is estimated by using person counts completed by the third party vendor. This method of calculation has not been verified by the FTA for statistical reporting and is used for scheduling purposes only. However, because of the granularity of detail, this information is useful for TOD applications.\r\n*Please note that the monthly level ridership and the station level ridership are calculated using two (2) independent methods that are not interchangeable and should not be compared for analysis purposes.","title":"MTA Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Data","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cqt2-ypem/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cqt2-ypem/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cqt2-ypem/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cqt2-ypem/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Transportation"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.maryland.gov/d/jmj7-9tkk","issued":"2015-07-30","modified":"2015-07-30","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"identifier":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/jmj7-9tkk","publisher":{"name":"data.maryland.gov"},"description":"Community Investment Tax Credits - Image Carousel","title":"Community Investment Tax Credits - Image Carousel","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/jmj7-9tkk/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/jmj7-9tkk/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/jmj7-9tkk/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/jmj7-9tkk/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.maryland.gov/d/ab68-n7ja","issued":"2015-07-28","modified":"2015-07-28","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["chesapeake","bay","baystat","solutions","basin","bmp","best","management","practice"],"identifier":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/ab68-n7ja","publisher":{"name":"data.maryland.gov"},"description":"Chesapeake Bay restoration solutions, Best Management Practices (BMPs), progress reporting by tributary basin.

Congress created the Community Development Block Grant Program under Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The primary objective is to develop viable communities, provide decent housing and a suitable living environment, and to expand economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) oversees the Program. The CDBG Program is comprised of two parts. The Entitlement Program is directly administered by HUD and provides Federal funds to large metropolitan \"entitlement\" communities. The States and Small Cities Program provides Federal funds to the States and Puerto Rico (with the exception of Hawaii) who then distribute funds to \"non-entitlement\" counties, small cities and towns. Congress allocates funds to the program annually. The Entitlement Program receives approximately 70% of the allocation and the remaining 30% is distributed to the States and Small Cities Program. Maryland's CDBG Program is administered by the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), in cooperation with the Maryland Department of Business and Economic Development (DBED). Funding Levels The State of Maryland receives its share of the 30% allocated to States and Small Cities based on poverty and population statistics. Maryland's Program is divided into two major funding categories: Community Development and Economic Development. Community Development receives approximately 72% of the allocation and Economic Development receives 25%. The remaining funds are spent for State administration of the Program (2% + $100,000) and technical assistance to grantees (1%). USES OF FUNDS CDBG funded projects must meet one of three national objectives: Principally benefits persons of low- and moderate- income Eliminates slum and blight Meets an urgent need of recent origin threatens public health and safety Eligible projects generally fall into three types: Housing Public facilities (water/sewer; streets; childcare, senior or community centers; shelters) Economic development projects Over a designated three-year period, the State must cumulatively use 70% of its allocation to benefit persons of low and moderate income CDBG funded programs must meet one of three national objectives: (1) Principally benefits persons of low- and moderate- income, (2) Eliminates slum and blight, and (3) Meets an urgent need of recent origin threatens public health and safety. Eligible projects generally fall into three types: (1) Housing, (2) Public facilities (water/sewer; streets; childcare, senior or community centers; shelters), and (3) Economic development projects. http://www.neighborhoodrevitalization.org/Programs/CDBG/CDBG.aspx","title":"Community Development Block Grant Awards (CDBG)","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/qubt-bv3h/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/qubt-bv3h/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/qubt-bv3h/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/qubt-bv3h/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Housing"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.maryland.gov/d/x3n6-c9ys","issued":"2015-04-19","modified":"2015-05-15","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:eliott.cohen@maryland.gov"},"keyword":["arrest","state police","north east","crime"],"identifier":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/x3n6-c9ys","publisher":{"name":"data.maryland.gov"},"description":"Maryland State Police North East Barrack \"F\" arrest log.

Any mileage changes  are field verified by SHA's data collections crews.   \r\n\r\nAVMT is calculated by multiplying the AADT on a road segment by the segment length.

The primary objective is to develop viable communities, provide decent housing and a suitable living environment, and to expand economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) oversees the Program. \r\nThe CDBG Program is comprised of two parts. The Entitlement Program is directly administered by HUD and provides Federal funds to large metropolitan \"entitlement\" communities. The States and Small Cities Program provides Federal funds to the States and Puerto Rico (with the exception of Hawaii) who then distribute funds to \"non-entitlement\" counties, small cities and towns. \r\nCongress allocates funds to the program annually. The Entitlement Program receives approximately 70% of the allocation and the remaining 30% is distributed to the States and Small Cities Program.\r\nMaryland's CDBG Program is administered by the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), in cooperation with the Maryland Department of Business and Economic Development (DBED). \r\nFunding Levels The State of Maryland receives its share of the 30% allocated to States and Small Cities based on poverty and population statistics. Maryland's Program is divided into two major funding categories: Community Development and Economic Development. Community Development receives approximately 72% of the allocation and Economic Development receives 25%. The remaining funds are spent for State administration of the Program (2% + $100,000) and technical assistance to grantees (1%). USES OF FUNDS CDBG funded projects must meet one of three national objectives: Principally benefits persons of low- and moderate- income Eliminates slum and blight Meets an urgent need of recent origin threatens public health and safety Eligible projects generally fall into three types: Housing Public facilities (water/sewer; streets; childcare, senior or community centers; shelters) Economic development projects Over a designated three-year period, the State must cumulatively use 70% of its allocation to benefit persons of low and moderate income\r\nCDBG funded programs must meet one of three national objectives: (1) Principally benefits persons of low- and moderate- income, (2) Eliminates slum and blight, and (3) Meets an urgent need of recent origin threatens public health and

The Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) provides financial support and training to these agencies. These counselors are the critical link in assisting individuals facing foreclosures, acting as a resource to negotiate reasonable terms with mortgage servicers, and advising citizens on the best actions to take to save their homes.

These data map hub and corridor elements within the green infrastructure. The Green Infrastructure Assessment was developed to provide decision support for Maryland's Department of Natural Resources land conservation programs. Ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving soils, regulating climate, and maintaining hydrologic function, are all provided by the existing expanses of forests, wetlands, and other natural lands. These ecologically valuable lands also provide marketable goods and services, like forest products, fish and wildlife, and recreation. The Green Infrastructure serves as vital habitat for wild species and contributes in many ways to the health and quality of life for Maryland residents. To identify and prioritize Maryland's green infrastructure, we developed a tool called the Green Infrastructure Assessment (GIA). The GIA was based on principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology, and provides a consistent approach to evaluating land conservation and restoration efforts in Maryland. It specifically attempts to recognize: a variety of natural resource values (as opposed to a single species of wildlife, for example), how a given place fits into a larger system, the ecological importance of natural open space in rural and developed areas, the importance of coordinating local, state and even interstate planning, and the need for a regional or landscape-level view for wildlife conservation. The GIA identified two types of important resource lands - \"hubs\" and \"corridors.\" \n\nHubs typically large contiguous areas, separated by major roads and/or human land uses, that contain one or more of the following: Large blocks of contiguous interior forest (containing at least 250 acres, plus a transition zone of 300 feet) Large wetland complexes, with at least 250 acres of unmodified wetlands; Important animal and plant habitats of at least 100 acres, including rare, threatened, and endangered species locations, unique ecological communities, and migratory bird habitats; relatively pristine stream and river segments (which, when considered with adjacent forests and wetlands, are at least 100 acres) that support trout, mussels, and other sensitive aquatic organisms; and existing protected natural resource lands which contain one or more of the above (for example, state parks and forests, National Wildlife Refuges, locally owned reservoir properties, major stream valley parks, and Nature Conservancy preserves). In the GIA model, the above features were identified from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial data that covered the entire state. Developed areas and major roads were excluded, areas less than 100 contiguous acres were dropped, adjacent forest and wetland were added to the remaining hubs, and the edges were smoothed. The average size of all hubs in the state is approximately 2200 acres.\n\n\nCorridors are linear features connecting hubs together to help animals and plant propagules to move between hubs. Corridors were identified using many sets of data, including land cover, roads, streams, slope, flood plains, aquatic resource data, and fish blockages. Generally speaking, corridors connect hubs of similar type (hubs containing forests are connected to one another; while those consisting primarily of wetlands are connected to others containing wetlands). Corridors generally follow the best ecological or \"most natural\" routes between hubs. Typically these are streams with wide riparian buffers and healthy fish communities. Other good wildlife corridors include ridge lines or forested valleys. Developed areas, major roads, and other unsuitable features were avoided.","title":"Maryland Green Infrastructure Hubs and Corridors","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/geospatial/hahp-aks6?method=export&format=KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/geospatial/hahp-aks6?method=export&format=KMZ","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kmz"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/geospatial/hahp-aks6?method=export&format=Shapefile","mediaType":"application/zip"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/geospatial/hahp-aks6?method=export&format=Original","mediaType":"application/zip"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/hahp-aks6/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/hahp-aks6/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"}],"theme":["Energy and Environment"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.maryland.gov/d/cx3k-8nq5","issued":"2013-03-08","modified":"2014-10-30","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["births","baby names","vital statistics administration"],"identifier":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cx3k-8nq5","publisher":{"name":"data.maryland.gov"},"description":"The most popular baby names are generated by Maryland Vital Statistics data on birth records for the most current year of data available for publication (2011).","title":"Maryland's Top Ten Most Popular Baby Names in 2011 by Race, Ethnicity, and Sex","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cx3k-8nq5/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cx3k-8nq5/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cx3k-8nq5/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cx3k-8nq5/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Health and Human Services"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.maryland.gov/d/p93z-n4v3","issued":"2013-03-04","modified":"2014-10-30","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"keyword":["brfss","asthma","alcohol","heart","cholesterol","diabetes","overweight","nutrition"],"identifier":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/p93z-n4v3","publisher":{"name":"data.maryland.gov"},"description":"The Maryland Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), is a is a statewide telephone survey that tracks prevalence and trends over time for many health variables.
