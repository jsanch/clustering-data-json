The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.","title":"Census 2010: Census Tracts for San Francisco (Zipped Shapefile format)","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"http://apps.sfgov.org/datafiles/view.php?file=sfgis/tl_2010_06075_tract10.zip","mediaType":"application/zip"}],"license":"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/","theme":["Geographic Locations and Boundaries"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.sfgov.org/d/yg87-cd6v","issued":"2013-10-03","modified":"2015-09-16","keyword":["phes","public health","flu","influenza","vaccines","vaccination","san francisco","environmental health","sfdph","sfphes"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:support@datasf.freshdesk.com"},"publisher":{"name":"data.sfgov.org"},"identifier":"https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/yg87-cd6v","description":"List of San Francisco Department of Public Health clinics offering flu vaccinations throughout the city in fall 2013.This dataset complies with the  emerging Data Specification for Flu Shot Locations.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.","title":"Census 2010: Census Blocks for San Francisco (Zipped Shapefile format)","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"http://apps.sfgov.org/datafiles/view.php?file=sfgis/tl_2010_06075_tabblock10.zip","mediaType":"application/zip"}],"license":"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/","theme":["Geographic Locations and Boundaries"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.sfgov.org/d/u89s-bsxm","issued":"2013-03-04","modified":"2015-09-15","keyword":["lobbyist","lobbying","mapping","ethics","disclosure"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:support@datasf.freshdesk.com"},"publisher":{"name":"data.sfgov.org"},"identifier":"https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/u89s-bsxm","description":"Lobbyists are required to accurately self-report all information required under the Lobbyist Ordinance.

The goal was to provide in the downtown quality open space in sufficient quantity and variety to meet the needs of downtown workers, residents and visitors.The POPOs data is available in KML and GIS Shapefile format.
