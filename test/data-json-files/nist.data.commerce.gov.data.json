The observations were made in collaboration with the European Southern Observatory (ESO), in order to provide calibration reference data for new high-resolution Echelle spectrographs, such as the Cryogenic High-Resolution IR Echelle Spectrograph ([CRIRES]), ESO's new IR spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope in Chile.","title":"NIST The Spectrum of Th-Ar Hollow Cathode Lamps in the 691nm to 5804nm region Database - SRD 161","programCode":["006:045"],"distribution":[{"downloadURL":"http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ThArLampAtlas/asciiDataTwo.txt","mediaType":"text/text"},{"downloadURL":"http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ThArLampAtlas/acsiiThArTable.html","mediaType":"text/html"},{"downloadURL":"http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ThArLampAtlas/atlas.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["006:55"],"landingPage":"http://tsapps.nist.gov/techtransfer/","issued":"2009-11-09","modified":"2015-05-22","keyword":["inventions","license","patent","technology"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"Paul Zielinski","hasEmail":"mailto:paul.zielinski@nist.gov"},"publisher":{"name":"National Institute of Standards and Technology"},"identifier":"https://nist.data.commerce.gov/api/views/rqvp-az2f","description":"NISTTech is a public database of patented technologies owned by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.","title":"NISTTech","programCode":["006:045"],"distribution":[{"downloadURL":"http://www.nist.gov/customcf/data/nist_tech.json","mediaType":"application/json"}],"dataQuality":true},{"accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["006:55"],"landingPage":"http://physics.nist.gov/halflife","issued":"2015-05-22","modified":"2015-05-22","keyword":["half-life","radionuclides"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"Standard Reference Data, http://www.nist.gov/srd/","hasEmail":"mailto:data@nist.gov"},"publisher":{"name":"National Institute of Standards and Technology"},"identifier":"https://nist.data.commerce.gov/api/views/raje-megs","description":"The half lives of many radionuclides have been measured in the Radioactivity Group of NIST.

Schima (1992), is a revised listing of the half lives determined at NIST since 1967. This table supersedes the table presented in NBS Special Publication 626 [D.D. Hoppes and F.J. Schima, ed.

The references are given for these values. Values revised since NBS Special Publication 626 for the half lives of various \"short-lived\" radionuclides arise from improved impurity analysis, incorporation of additional data from new sources, and re-evaluation of old data. Values in common usage in certificates and reports are available from the National Nuclear Data Center (http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat2/). In case of discrepant data, the NIST value is recommended.","title":"NIST Radionuclide Half-Life Measurements - SRD 120","programCode":["006:045"],"distribution":[{"downloadURL":"http://www.nist.gov/pml/data/halflife-ascii.cfm","mediaType":"text/text"},{"downloadURL":"http://www.nist.gov/pml/data/halflife-html.cfm","mediaType":"text/html"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"http://www.metallurgy.nist.gov/phase/solder/solder.html","bureauCode":["006:55"],"issued":"2015-05-22","modified":"2015-05-22","keyword":["materials","materials science","measurement","metallurgy","phase","phase diagram","phase equilibria","science","solder","standards","technical activities","thermodynamic"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"National Institute of Standards and Technology, www.nist.gov/srd","hasEmail":"mailto:data@nist.gov"},"publisher":{"name":"National Institute of Standards and Technology"},"identifier":"https://nist.data.commerce.gov/api/views/r92p-27e3","description":"Phase Diagrams and Computational Thermodynamics - Solder Systems predicts melting temperatures and freezing ranges of lead-free solders which are used to remove lead-containing components from commercial products.

In this method, all chemical compounds are annotated in terms of standard chemical structural fragments. These fragments are then organized into a data tree based on their chemical substructures. Search engines have been developed to use this data tree. These search engines use the Chem-BLAST technique to search on the fragments and look for their chemical structural neighbors. The technique was originally developed in the context of the HIV Structural database to enable a query on inhibitors of HIV protease. (See http://xpdb.nist.gov/hivsdb/hivsdb.html.) Recently the method has been significantly improved to extend to the ligands found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). (See http://xpdb.nist.gov/chemblast/pdb.html.)  The method establishes a tree-like relationship between the rings found in three-letter codes that denote ligands of the structures found in the PDB. Semantic Web relations are established between the structural scaffolds of the ligands and organizes them in an XML database utilizing the Webï¿½??s Resource Description Framework (RDF). An Adobe Flex-based interface is used to present this information on the Web. Plans are under way to extend this work to non-ring type scaffolds as well. Chem-BLAST has also been extended to structures in PubChem. http://xpdb.nist.gov/chemblast/pdb.pl which includes several non-ring standard reused groups such as sulfates. Efforts are under way to use the underlying principles of Chem-BLAST to enable query on non-structural data, such as cell image data http://xpdb.nist.gov/cell/image.pl.","title":"NIST Chem-BLAST Gateway for PDB - SRD 155","programCode":["006:045"],"distribution":[{"downloadURL":"http://xpdb.nist.gov/chemblast/pdb.html","mediaType":"text/html"}],"describedBy":"http://xpdb.nist.gov/pdb_chem_blast/help.html"},{"accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["006:55"],"landingPage":"http://nist.gov/nist-instruments.cfm","issued":"2009-04-27","modified":"2015-05-22","keyword":["equipment","instruments","user facility"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"Paul Zielinski","hasEmail":"mailto:tpo@nist.gov"},"publisher":{"name":"National Institute of Standards and Technology"},"identifier":"https://nist.data.commerce.gov/api/views/7yff-6r62","description":"The National Institute of Standards and Technology has two user facilities, the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology and the NIST Center for Neutron Research.
