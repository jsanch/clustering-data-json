ACOs that generated savings earned a performance payment if they met the quality standard. Quality performance for ACOs with 2014 start dates that are in their first performance year is based on complete and accurate reporting of all required quality measures for Calendar Year 2014. Notes: 1 - (Gross) Generated savings: Total savings (first to last dollar) for ACOs whose savings equaled or exceeded their minimum savings rates (variable based on ACO size under Track 1 and flat 2% under Track 2). This amount does not account for the application of the ACO’s final sharing rate based on quality performance, reduction due to sequestration or repayment of advance payments. 2 - (Gross) Generated losses: Total losses (first to last dollar) for Track 2 ACOs whose losses equaled or exceeded their minimum loss rate (flat 2%). This amount does not account for the application of the ACO’s final sharing rate based on quality performance. 3 - Total earned shared savings: The ACO’s share of savings for ACOs whose savings equaled or exceeded their minimum savings rates, and who were eligible for a performance payment because they met the program’s quality performance standard. This amount accounts for the application of the ACO’s final sharing rate based on quality performance (up to 50% under Track 1 and up to 60% under Track 2), as well as the reduction in performance payment due to sequestration. This amount does not account for repayment of advance payments. 4 - Total earned shared losses: The ACO’s share of losses for Track 2 ACOs whose losses equaled or exceeded their minimum loss rate (flat 2%). This amount accounts for the application of the ACO’s final loss sharing rate (which does not exceed 60%) based on quality performance. 5 - Successfully Reported Quality: ACOs are considered to have successfully reported quality if they completely reported in 2014. 6 - Quality Score: ACOs with 2014 start dates will have a “P4R” (Pay for Reporting) displayed for the Quality Score to reflect that their quality performance is based on complete and accurate reporting. For more information on how the Overall Quality Score was determined for ACOs with an Agreement Start Date in 2012 or 2013, please refer to the Medicare Shared Savings Program Quality Measure Benchmarks for the 2014 Reporting Year document posted on the Shared Savings Program website http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/sharedsavingsprogram/Quality_Measures_Standards.html. ACO-1 through ACO-33: ACOs that did not successfully report CAHPS measures in 2014 will have a dash \"-\" displayed for CAHPS measures (ACO-1 through ACO-7). ACOs that did not successfully report GPRO Web Interface measures in 2014 will have a dash \"-\" displayed for GPRO Web Interface measures (ACO-12 through ACO-33). These measure fields appear as blank cells in the downloaded file (the dash is not displayed). For measure ACO-11, if no providers were eligible for this measure due to the measure's inclusion/exclusion criteria, then \"N/A\" (Not Applicable) will appear in place of a performance rate. For measures ACO-12 through ACO-33, if no beneficiaries were eligible for this measure due to the measure's inclusion/exclusion criteria, then an \"N/A\" (Not Applicable) will appear in the place of a performance rate. ^Measures marked with a caret (^) are measures where a lower performance rate is indicative of better quality.

Performance year 1 is a 21- or 18-month period for ACOs with 2012 start dates, and a 12 month period for ACOs with 2013 start dates. ACOs that generated savings earned a performance payment if they met the quality standard. For the first Performance Year, CMS defined the quality performance standard as complete and accurate reporting for all quality measures. Quality performance for Performance Year 1 reconciliation for ACOs with 2012 start dates is based on complete and accurate reporting of all required quality measures for Calendar Years 2012 and 2013. Quality performance for Performance Year 1 reconciliation for ACOs with 2013 start dates is based on complete and accurate reporting of all required quality measures for Calendar Year 2013. The quality performance results provided in the Performance Year 1 announcement reflect Calendar Year 2013 performance rates for 220 ACOs.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1 - (Gross) Generated savings: Total savings (first to last dollar) for ACOs whose savings equaled or exceeded their minimum savings rates (variable based on ACO size under Track 1 and flat 2% under Track 2). This amount does not account for the application of the ACO’s final sharing rate based on quality performance, reduction due to sequestration or repayment of advance payments.\r\n2 - (Gross) Generated losses: Total losses (first to last dollar) for Track 2 ACOs whose losses equaled or exceeded their minimum loss rate (flat 2%). This amount does not account for the application of the ACO’s final sharing rate based on quality performance.\r\n3 - Total earned shared savings:  The ACO’s share of savings for ACOs whose savings equaled or exceeded their minimum savings rates, and who were eligible for a performance payment because they met the program’s quality performance standard. This amount accounts for the application of the ACO’s final sharing rate based on quality performance (50% under Track 1 and 60% under Track 2 for PY1), as well as the reduction in performance payment due to sequestration. This amount does not account for repayment of advance payments.\r\n4 - Total earned shared losses:  The ACO’s share of losses for Track 2 ACOs whose losses equaled or exceeded their minimum loss rate (flat 2%). This amount accounts for the application of the ACO’s final loss sharing rate (which does not exceed 60%) based on quality performance.\r\nN/A = Not Available\r\n5 - Successfully Reported Quality: ACOs are considered to have successfully reported quality if they completely reported in both 2012 and 2013. ACOs who did not successfully report in 2013 will not have performance rates for GPRO Web Interface measures displayed.\r\n6 - ACO-11 performance rate unavailable: No providers eligible for this measure due to measure's inclusion/exclusion criteria.\r\n7 - Performance rate unavailable: No beneficiaries eligible for this measure due to the measure's inclusion/exclusion criteria.\r\n 8 - Performance rate unavailable: ACO did not satisfactorily report in 2013.\r\n* ACO did not successfully report in the first reporting period (2012) but did successfully report in their second reporting period (2013).\r\n^Measures marked with a caret (^) are measures where a lower performance rate is indicative of better quality.\r\nFor a crosswalk of ACO measure numbers to ACO measure names, please consult the following table: http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/sharedsavingsprogram/Downloads/ACO-Shared-Savings-Program-Quality-Measures.pdf.  \r\n\r\nDisclaimer – This information is current as of October 2014.

A claim for a sampled beneficiary is only included in the PUF if the combination of all six (6) variables is shared by at least eleven (11) claims pertaining to at least eleven (11) distinct beneficiaries in the population (but not necessarily the sample). 4.

This property prevents users from linking data across multiple files for identification purposes.","title":"2010 Basic Stand Alone Durable Medical Equipment Line Items PUF","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/api/views/5b3y-9vj6/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/api/views/5b3y-9vj6/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/api/views/5b3y-9vj6/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/api/views/5b3y-9vj6/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Public Use Files"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cms.gov/d/mvd4-2t3p","issued":"2012-10-15","modified":"2014-04-05","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:innovate@cms.hhs.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cms.gov/api/views/mvd4-2t3p","publisher":{"name":"data.cms.gov"},"description":"Testing the efficacy of the patient-centered medical home among Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs).","title":"FQHC Advanced Primary Care Practice Demonstration Participants","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/api/views/mvd4-2t3p/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/api/views/mvd4-2t3p/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/api/views/mvd4-2t3p/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/api/views/mvd4-2t3p/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Government"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cms.gov/d/ucun-6i4t","issued":"2012-08-22","modified":"2013-08-26","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:charlene.harven@cms.hhs.gov"},"keyword":["npi","phase","therapy","manual medical review"],"identifier":"https://data.cms.gov/api/views/ucun-6i4t","publisher":{"name":"data.cms.gov"},"description":"The Therapy Provider Phase Information dataset is a tool for providers to search by their National Provider Identifier (NPI) number to determine their phase for manual medical review of therapy claims.","title":"Therapy Provider Phase Information","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/api/views/ucun-6i4t/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/api/views/ucun-6i4t/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/api/views/ucun-6i4t/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/api/views/ucun-6i4t/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}]}  ]
