The YRBS is conducted biennially and collects data on a variety of youth risk behaviors including tobacco use. The YRBS uses a two-stage cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in high schools (grades 9-12).  The YRBS uses SUDAAN to calculate asymmetric confidence intervals based on the logit transformation. The logit transformation constrains confidence interval limits to vary between a lower limit of 0% and an upper limit of 100%.   The data for the STATE System were extracted from YRBSS surveys from participating states.

Data from the AQS is considered the \"gold standard\" for determining outdoor air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high.

The survey has been conducted for more than 50 years. Estimates obtained from the CPS include employment, unemployment, earnings, hours of work, and other indicators. Supplemental surveys include questions about a variety of topics, including an annual social and economic supplement, school enrollment, work schedules, voting and registration, job tenure and occupational mobility, food security, and tobacco use.\r\n\r\nThe data for the STATE System were obtained through the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS).  Tobacco topics included are cigarette smoking status, cigarette smoking prevalence by demographics, cigarette smoking frequency, cigarette consumption, quit attempts, cigar use, pipe use, smokeless tobacco use, and smokefree rules/policies in homes and worksites.","title":"Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) Data","programCode":["009:029"],"distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/4y6p-yphk/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/4y6p-yphk/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/4y6p-yphk/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/4y6p-yphk/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Survey Data"]},{"accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:20"],"landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/ffbi-is3j","issued":"2015-07-14","modified":"2015-08-08","keyword":["osh","office on smoking and health","policy","state system","tobacco","tobacco settlement payments"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/ffbi-is3j","description":"1999-2015.
