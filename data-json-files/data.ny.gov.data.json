This data set presents information on the amount of the distribution of these taxes back to the appropriate taxing jurisdictions during the ten most recent state fiscal years ended March 31. The state’s sales tax is distributed to the state during the same month of collection. Generally, all local sales taxes collected are distributed back to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction in the month subsequent to collection. A large majority of the distributions reflect collections from taxable sales reported and remitted during the preceding month. However, the net distributions also include adjustments for prior taxable sales periods resulting from resolving returns processing exception issues, and are also affected by timing of remittances by sales tax vendors as determined by their annual amount of taxable sales. Local taxing jurisdictions’ fiscal years are not identical to the state fiscal year. Distribution information in this data set is presented by state fiscal year to be consistent with other state tax collection information presented in the Annual Statistical Report of New York State Tax Collections.

The survey sample was stratified by the size of the HVAC contractor company: 28 survey completes for small companies (defined as having 1-10 employees) and 19 survey completes for large companies (defined as larger than 10 employees.) The surveys focused on employer or company information, sales of energy efficient HVAC equipment, installation practices, training, and experience with NYS energy efficiency programs.2. Multifamily Owner/Manager (MOM): This dataset includes data from 219 completed Multifamily owner and manager surveys. The types of data collected during the survey cover property characteristics, heating and cooling equipment, water heating equipment, tenant appliances, lighting, purchasing decision, common areas, clothes washing and drying, and miscellaneous equipment. The data is segmented to cover both common space equipment and, to the degree possible, tenant-unit equipment, such as refrigerators or clothes washers that are included in the rental by the building ownership.3. Single/Multifamily Occupant (SMO): This dataset includes 2,982 single-family and 379 multifamily occupant survey completes for a total of 3,361 responses. The survey involved 2,285 Web, 1,041 telephone, and 35 mini-inspection surveys. The survey collected information on the following building characteristics: building shell, kitchen appliances, heating and cooling equipment, water heating equipment, clothes washing and drying equipment, lighting, pool and spa equipment, small household appliances, miscellaneous energy consuming equipment, as well as behaviors and characteristics of respondents.","title":"RSBS: New York State Residential Statewide Baseline Study: HVAC, MOM, SMO","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.ny.gov/download/46as-6mg4/application/zip","mediaType":"application/zip"}],"theme":["Energy & Environment"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.ny.gov/d/u925-8y2g","issued":"2015-07-15","modified":"2015-11-04","contactPoint":{"fn":"Open Data NY","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@its.ny.gov"},"keyword":["training","safety","insurance","accident","crash","driver","points","defensive","course"],"identifier":"https://data.ny.gov/api/views/u925-8y2g","publisher":{"name":"State of New York"},"description":"This data set measures and describes participation in PIRP.

OVS supports statewide, comprehensive victim/witness assistance services in all sectors of the community. Criminal justice agencies, non-profit victim programs and specific municipal programs all receive support. Examples include DA offices, Probation Departments, YWCAs, local police departments, hospitals, and nonprofit organizations.

QCEW data encompass approximately 97 percent of New York's nonfarm employment, providing a virtual census of employees and their wages as well as the most complete universe of employment and wage data, by industry, at the State, regional and county levels. \"Covered\" employment refers broadly to both private-sector employees as well as state, county, and municipal government employees insured under the New York State Unemployment Insurance (UI) Act. Federal employees are insured under separate laws, but are considered covered for the purposes of the program. Employee categories not covered by UI include some agricultural workers, railroad workers, private household workers, student workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers. QCEW data are similar to monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) data in that they reflect jobs by place of work; therefore, if a person holds two jobs, he or she is counted twice. However, since the QCEW program, by definition, only measures employment covered by unemployment insurance laws, its totals will not be the same as CES employment totals due to the employee categories excluded by UI.
