The IDB supported the design of a methodology that evaluates critical points to assess the civil services and carried out country evaluations in 2004. Between 2011 and 2013, a second group of diagnostics second group of diagnostics were completed (with the support of the Inter-American Development Bank, and in the case of Central American countries and Dominican Republic with the support of the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation and Development –AECID- and the Central American Integration System-SICA). Scores are available for 2004, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015 (year of second and/or third measurement varies per country). During the first assessment, 93 critical points were identified; each of those fed a subsystem and an index. In 2010 the methodology was simplified to 33 critical points and the base line was recalibrated to ensure comparability. The methodology is based in the identification of critical points that feed 8 subsystems: 1. Human Resources Planning, 2. Work Organization, 3. Employment management, 4. Performance management, 5. Compensation management, 6. Development management, 7. Human and social relations management, 8. HR Function organization; and 5 indexes: 1. Efficiency, 2. Merit, 3. Structural consistency, 4.

It is a unique database of its kind since: 1) It takes into consideration the distinct responsiveness of different types of revenues to changes in the output gap: In order to adjust for the impact of the business cycle on revenues, we calculate individual elasticities for each source of revenue (i.e. direct taxes, indirect taxes, revenues from non-renewable resources, etc.). Since the different types of revenues in the region have different sensitivities to changes in the output gap, this disaggregated approach allows for a more fine-tuned adjustment. 2) It includes estimations of SFBs based on output gaps’ projections available in “real time”. In addition to giving estimations of the actual SFBs, we provide with estimations of the SFBs that would have resulted should the projections on output gaps available to policymakers at the time of designing fiscal policy (data in “real time”) have been correct. This is in contrast to much of the existing work on structural fiscal balances that makes only an “ex post” analysis using actual and revised information on the output gaps. 3) It allows assessing the response of fiscal policy to the business cycle.

More importantly, Latin America policymakers still largely ignore the potential of taxation to contribute to other important development goals. Governments have repeatedly missed the chance to influence consumption and production patterns by using taxes to effect relative price changes.

In 2010 the methodology was simplified to 33 critical points and the base line was recalibrated to ensure comparability.

It aimed at generating data that make it possible to i) measure electoral volatility at the individual level during political campaigns, and ii) explore the ways in which both short and long-term factors affect this process and the ultimate vote decision. The Brazilian Electoral Panel Study is composed of three waves conducted in March and April, August, and November of 2010. The first wave was implemented about six months prior to the first round of the election and before the official launch of the political campaign that began in July with the nomination of candidates. It was conducted as part of the 2010 AmericasBarometer of the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP). Wave Two of the survey predated the beginning of the Free Electoral Airtime (Horário Gratuito de Propaganda Eleitoral or HGPE), in which candidates for all offices have 45 minutes of daily access to television broadcasting during prime-time hours. Finally, Wave Three was carried out immediately after the second round of the election, which occurred on October 31. The panel sought to establish baseline measures of vote intention, policy preferences, and several related factors, following longstanding debates on electoral behavior in Latin America and the United States.<br><br><b>Click here to access the data: https://mydata.iadb.org/d/s24e-dvnk</b></br></br>","title":"Brazilian Electoral Panel Study ( BEPS)","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://mydata.iadb.org/download/s24e-dvnk/application/zip","mediaType":"application/zip"}],"theme":["Reform / Modernization of the State"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://mydata.iadb.org/d/2s4s-9a98","issued":"2015-04-03","modified":"2015-10-01","keyword":["fiscal burden","presión fiscal","latin america","américa latina","caribe","caribbean","ingresos tributarios","ingresos fiscales","ingresos impositivos","impuestos","taxation","fiscal revenues","tax revenues"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:ALBERTOBA@iadb.org"},"publisher":{"name":"mydata.iadb.org"},"identifier":"https://mydata.iadb.org/api/views/2s4s-9a98","description":"This comprehensive database, produced by the Inter-American Center of Tax Administrations (CIAT) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), provides detailed yearly series on taxes, social security contributions and other fiscal revenues for 23 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.<br><br><b>Click here to access the data: https://mydata.iadb.org/d/2s4s-9a98</b></br></br>","title":"Latin America and the Caribbean Fiscal Burden Database","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://mydata.iadb.org/download/2s4s-9a98/application/zip","mediaType":"application/zip"}],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/legalcode","theme":["Finance"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://mydata.iadb.org/d/kv5s-45gg","issued":"2015-04-03","modified":"2015-09-28","contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:res@iadb.org"},"keyword":["product policies","ict","taxes","housing","productivity","exclusion","quality of life","debt","institutions"],"identifier":"https://mydata.iadb.org/api/views/kv5s-45gg","publisher":{"name":"mydata.iadb.org"},"description":"Development in the Americas (DIA) is the flagship publication of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).
